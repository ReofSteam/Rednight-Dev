PHI_japanese_military_occupation:0 "Japanese Military Occupation"
PHI_japanese_military_occupation_desc:0 "The last decade has been nothing short of harrowing for the philippines. Chaos started following the outbreak of the American civil war, continued with the declaration of independence by President Emilio Aquinaldo, and exploded during the bloody Japanese takeover of 1943.Today the Philippines can finally rest under the administration of the Phillipine Executive Commission. Free from imperialists and traitors, the IJA will demand order and productivity for the new imperial possession, or else."
PHI_promised_independent:0 "Promised Independence"
PHI_promised_independent_desc:0 "Despite its brutal suppression of the independence in 1943, Tokyo has made grand promises. Since the occupation began, co-prosperity sphere officials have consistently claimed a day will come when guns and bayonets will no longer be necessary. “Independence” may yet return to the Philippines, though what exactly this entails is anyone's guess. "
PHI_guerllia_resistance:0 "Guerilla Resistance"
PHI_guerllia_resistance_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the National Government, patriotic Fillipinos have waged a guerilla war from the jungle. Their struggle would see its peak in the failed National Revolution of 1947. Nowadays, the failure of this revolt has temporarily tamed rebel efforts.Still, the hills may be quieter, but they are not silent. Both the Leftist UNDF and the National Government partisans remain technically active, each gathering strength. The IJA must be vigilant, for there is still the chance of a pointed gun behind every shed."
PHI_native_attitude_apathetic:0 "Native Attitude: Apathetic" 
PHI_native_attitude_apathetic_desc:0 "While real enthusiasm for the co-prosperity sphere’s mission is exceedingly rare, there is enough ambivalence to keep the people in check. At least for the moment."

POLITICS_MASAHARU_HOMMA_DESC:0 "§YMiliary Governor of the Phillipines§!\n\nGovernor-General Masaharu Homma has fought many battles over his long career. Each conquest brought great tribute to both his homeland, and his honor. Homma however, never let these victories inflate his ego.\n\nA true believer in the stated mission of the Co-prosperity sphere, Homma now finds himself in charge of one of his previous victims: the Philippines. It is within this station the aging general will fight his final battle, a battle for the hearts of the people. These islands will be pacified with a gentle but firm hand, and their trust in the empire will be secured."
