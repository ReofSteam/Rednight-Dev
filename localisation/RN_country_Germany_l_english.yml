POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "§Ylieutenant-General T.E Lawrence - British Forces in Germany§!\n\nAs a young archaeologist swept into conducting espionage for the old English government, Lawrence would stumble into a key role organizing Arab revolts against the Ottoman Empire .It was here the young man truly came into his own, showcasing a remarkable talent for both leadership and combat\n\nLawrence returned home to find a Britain humbled by its losses, and more divided than ever before. In the aftermath of the British revolution, where a new government, eager for any with military experience, ushered him into service as director of the R.E.D. Here he brought a unique camaraderie to the once stuffy organization.\n\nChairman Mosley considered Lawrence a potential threat to his power. This status was soon compounded by unsubstantiated allegations of a royalist conspiracy..\n\nSoon Lawrence found himself Governor of an occupation zone, a thinly veiled attempt to distance him from the Isles. Bitter over the loss of his R.E.D and the increasing grip of a man he considers cowardly, Lawrence’s once middling criticism has grown into an outright public disdain for the grand protector.\n\nRegardless, such complaints will never hold bearing on his commitment to duty.The administration of these territories is a new challenge, and like all he has faced before, it will be met with great vigor and the faintest hint of a smile."
POLITICS_PIERRE_BROSSOLETTE_DESC:0 "§YBrigadier-General Pierre Brossolette - French Forces in Germany§!\n\nDuring a short career as a journalist,  Pierre bore witness to the same bureaucratic infighting and corruption so detested in the Third republic. Dejected, he often wondered if France had simply traded thieves for bureaucrats?\n\nIn the decade preceding the second weltkrieg, Pierre enlisted in the people's army out of a strong desire to break the German reactionary hegemony. It was here he spent climbing the ranks all the way to brigadier general.Pierre is older now, and by all accounts tame. Away from the dogmatic revanchism of Paris, it was his dutiful and stern temperament that afforded him the role of an effective and productive governor.\n\nHowever, there are rumors. Hushed in whispers among militiamen and conscripts, visions persist. Perhaps there is  a different Pierre. One who, in his most private moments, still carries a passionate fire. According to some, the Brigadier-General is prone to lengthy monologues, extolling his pacifist desires, internationalist sentiments, and above all, a hatred of the talking heads of the BGT."
POLITICS_MARPAC_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Joint Occupation Zone; a revolutionary shield against the Russian beast. While it is crucially important, it is also incredibly chaotic. Military forces from all Marpac nations gather in this small area, awaiting the surely inevitable war to come.\n\nOversight of such a omni linguistic and disparate defense can be trusted to no single governor. Thus, the task falls to the Joint Control Council. Comprising military officials from four nations, it serves as both a high command as well as a civilian administrative body. Working around the clock to ensure professionalism between units, coordination, and fulfillment of needs, its burdens are grand. Things are never easy, but they are necessary. The council will not blink  in the face of its reactionary enemy, lest we all tumble back into the dark ages."
POLITICS_OTTO_GROTEWOHL_DESC:0 "Had any been asked to predict the future of the German Empire in the waning days of the second weltkrieg, no lips would utter the name Otto Grotewohl. Nevertheless, the mild mannered left-spd politician now finds himself head of the provisional administration in Hamburg.\nHistory has a funny sense of humour, a fact clearly evident to Otto when he was interrupted painting his new bicycle shop by two sharply dressed frenchmen. Since then he has been a unifying figure, working tireless and compassionately to mend old wounds between the KPD, SPD and FAUD.\nAs Otto’s term advances, it has become clear that the French government made a wise choice. Besides being an efficient administrator, Otto has become a soothing presence in uncertain and calamitous times. While his rule is unlikely to last forever, many in Hamburg will surely be sad to see Grotewohl go."
