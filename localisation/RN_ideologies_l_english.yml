#Description
social_nationalist_subtype_desc:0 "§GSocial Nationalism§!\nSocial Nationalism is an umbrella term that refers to movements that are both socialist and nationalistic in nature. Although Social Nationalist movements can have many characteristics that differentiate them from each other as well as different economic and political visions (ranging from anticolonial movements to plain out chauvinism) they all share in common the embracement of socialist and nationalist aesthetics and visions."
marxist_subtype_desc:0 "§GMarxism§!\nMarxism is an ideology that suggests that the material circumstances of capitalism will inevitably result in workers’ revolts and revolutions of emancipation. Marxists often criticise social democracy as reinforcing and protecting capitalism from the inevitable, also criticising other socialist ideologies for utopianism or reformism. Marxists of the council-communist and other varieties also criticise Leninism and related forms of Marxism, searching for alternate routes of achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat."
libertarian_subtype_desc:0 "§GLibertarianism§!\nLibertarians reject the state as an agent for the common good for the workers of the world. Libertarians seek to collectively own the means of production on the community level, with no space for state-run or directed industry. They also advocate for the near-complete devolution of political power, in many cases using the trade union as the basic political unit."
moderate_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§GModerate Socialsim§!\nAn umbrella term that encompasses many different socialist schools of thought, moderate socialism is used to describe those which may appear less revolutionary than their marxist counterparts. Moderate socialists in many occasions prefer to use parliamentary democracy to bring about the downfall of capitalism - though some may not even seek to do so, such as market socialists. The ideology also encompasses religious socialists and agrarian socialists."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "§GSocial Democracy§!\nSocial democracy promotes the incorporation of socialist ideas, such as welfare and public industries, to the framework of capitalist, liberal democracy. Social democrats today are split on whether to seek rapprochement with the International, or whether to remain steadfast in their anti-marxist identity. In the remaining liberal democracies of the world, they receive criticism from the left for not showing enough solidarity with international socialism, while the right accuse them of being entryists that seek to supplant democracy."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "§GSocial Liberalism§!\nLiberalism proposes two main kinds of freedom. The first is economic freedom, that people be free to pursue their own economic ventures whether they be operating as individuals or companies. The second is social freedom, that people are free to express themselves in whatever way they please without fear of retaliation from either state or fellow citizen. As such, the liberal state fulfils the task of protecting its citizens from abuse and with maintaining their liberties as well. Typical policies include laissez-faire economics, secular policies and welfare to a somewhat limited extent. Liberals usually occupy a middle ground in democracies and often work with their immediate right and left. "
conservative_subtype_desc:0 "§GConservatism§!\nConservatism represents a movement opposed to rapid social change and sudden upheaval. Conservatives instead pursue the preservation of traditional values, whether they be religious or otherwise more secular in nature. They are therefore natural allies of institutions such as monarchies and the church. Virtues like patriotism and loyalty are held in high regard and as such police and soldiers are presented as excellent role-models.\nConservatives attempt to make reforms in order to best protect these social customs and are most often found working alongside liberals in democracies."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "§GAuthoritarian Democracy§!\nThe term authoritarian democracy is a very loose one, applicable to a number of different political factions with very few constants between other than the fact that they view democracy as nothing more than a formality to cement their authoritarian rule, their policies otherwise range from being open to liberal, social-democrat-like, social reforms, to being nothing more than authoritarian conservatives. Authoritarian Democracy also ranges through different systems of government from, seemingly, democratic republics to semi-constitutional monarchies and is generally seen as an alternative to the absolutism of old in the latter."
autocratic_subtype_desc:0 "§GAutocracy§!\nAn autocracy is simply put, a nation where one man has absolute (although not always unquestioned) power. The title or position of said autocrat varies deeply. Some are monarchs, holding onto ancient power invested in their forebears centuries ago. Others are military strongmen, having wrested power through force. Then there are those that have come to power through intrigue or even the popular mandate. Regardless of their title or rank, they all share in their totalitarian level of power in their respective territory. For this reason, autocrats are able to pursue whatever plans or policy they wish, without need for much discussion. Beyond their specific level of control, autocrats can have a variety of economic, social, religious and foreign policies."
fundamentalist_subtype_desc:0 "§GFundamentalism§!\nFundamentalism is an umbrella term for all sorts of reactionary ideologies which advocate for a return to religion and religious law and rule and other more esoteric forms of right-wing ideologies; depending on the movement it can be opposed to national republicanism and view it as a flawed or heretical product of Enlightenment."
voynist_subtype_desc:0 "§GVoynism§!\nThe term “voynism” is a pejorative term used by the left and centre to characterise the rulership of the Vozhd of Russia, Boris Savinkov, and those that have sought to emulate his ideals abroad. The term was originally coined by western academics in the aftermath of Savinkov’s consolidation as both President and Prime Minister of Russia in 1937. The word came to be as tribute to his magnum opus - Voyna, meaning war. The book encompasses his thoughts and doctrine - as well as an analysis of Russian history through the personification of the nation, Mokosh. The ideology that the Vozhd forged is called National Revival, and is characterised by a revolutionary republican nature, fierce anti-socialism, militarism, preservation of the national identity and cultural renewal.
