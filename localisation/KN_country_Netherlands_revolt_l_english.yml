DRE_RVNE_idea:0 "Council of National Unity"
DRE_RVNE_idea_desc:0 "The Raad van Nationale Eenheid or the Council of National Unity is established by General van Voorst tot Voorst to unite the various resistance groups around the Netherlands into one cohesive partisan group and is the thing that the Dutch resistance calls a “ruling body” or “parliament”. \n\nAn amalgamation of many political parties, resistance groups, and secret societies, the RvNE is a united front that is united in their goal to reclaim the Dutch homeland. But when the Netherlands have been reclaimed, what will happen to the RvNE is another question..."
DRE_radio_oranje:0 "Radio Oranje"
DRE_radio_oranje_desc:0 "When the Franco-British Invasion came, the Government and the Royal Family fled to exile in Denmark, leaving us behind to fight the ever-growing horde of leftists, or so they thought. \n\nYet every night, we can always gather around a radio and hear the voices of our rightful Government and even Her Majesty the Queen, telling us that our struggles are valiant and our sacrifices noble and that they had no intentions to abandon or forsake us in our rightful war against the foreign occupiers and traitors."
DRE_the_resistance:0 "The Resistance"
DRE_the_resistance_desc:0 "After the End of the Second Weltkrieg, INFOR retreated their forces from our country, effectively leaving the country to the Reconstruction Council and their army. Since then, we have launched raids, harrassed their forces and killed their commanders, fighting an underground war against these godless traitors. But now, we are fighting a true war against these traitors to reclaim our lost homes. To arms!"
