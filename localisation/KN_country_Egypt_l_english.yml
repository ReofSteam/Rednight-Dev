EGY.1.t:0 "A Red Coalition"
EGY.1.d:0 "The usually lively central committee of the Arab Socialist Party was abruptly hush. Michel Aflaq clears his throat and approaches the stand. \n\n“Comrades, Arabs, there is no doubt that the era of revolution is soon to come. Each day the people grow stronger, while the landlords, the aristocrats, and the swindlers in Alexandria grow weaker and more isolated. There is no doubt, come this election,  that the tyrant Serageddin will lose. The people have seen his reign: brutality, repression, and corruption. But the people still know how to vote and democracy will prevail. However, it may not be the forces of reaction that defeat us, but our own internal squabbles. In my time in France, I saw socialists of all leanings and ideologies stand shoulder to shoulder at the barricades and in the trenches to defend the revolution. How, in Egypt, do we expect the same when the left is so divided? How do we expect to organize a coherent labor movement when there are five different unions, all of which hate each other? How do we expect to win the election or to win over the people when five different leftist parties compete for the workers’ attention? \n\nIt is imperative that we end this petty factionalism and stand in a parliamentary coalition so we may win over the people and ensure a successful transition to socialism. Our socialist government must truly represent all peoples of Arabia, and as such should not be solely composed of the urban proletariat, which is our party’s support base. For if we try to take power without the support of peasants, for example, we could find our vast countryside in revolt and the revolution would be discredited. It would of course be up to the central committee and the processes of democratic centralism that we would choose what exact parties and groups we would ally with.”  \n\nAflaq stepped down from the podium. The furious scratching of pens echoed through the chamber as each committee member wrote down yay or nay on a slip of colored paper and passed them up to the front faced down.  "
EGY.1.a:0 "The motion has passed"

EGY.2.t:0 "Left Unity"
EGY.2.d:0 "Although considered something of a fringe party, the Arab Communist Party is a highly organized and rapidly growing movement under Khalid Bakdash, who has been referred to as the Arab Lenin by mainstream Egyptian newspapers. Bakdash himself hasn’t exactly denied the nickname either, and his admiration for Bolshevism and the PCF can be seen in his theory and his party’s methods of organization. This has also made the party a threatening boogeyman for the right wing and the liberals who use the Arab Communist Party as an example of the “violence of leftism”. \n\nMichel Aflaq (who happened to go to the same French university as Bakdash) has proposed that the Communists dissolve their own ultra-left coalition and ally with the Arab Socialist Party to strengthen Nasser’s bid for the presidency as well as our power on the parliament. However, some in the party fear the communists may try and infiltrate the arab socialists as well as that an alliance with radicals could scare off more moderate voters."
EGY.2.a:0 "Any comrade is a friend."
EGY.2.b:0 "Communism is just not popular!"

EGY.3.t:0 "Completing the Red Coalition"
EGY.3.d:0 "In order to stand a chance at defeating the forces of reaction at the ballot box, the red coalition needs more members. Gamal Abdel Nasser has proposed a solution of allying with center-left Labor Party of Abbas Halim, who had previously been the Arab Socialists’ primary foe. Many more radical members of the Arab Socialist Party detest such an alliance as a capitulation to bourgeois reformism and a few have even threatened to leave the party. However, such an alliance may be the Red Coalition’s only hope and, if the revolution does come, it would be better for the revolutionaries to have as much support as possible."
EGY.3.a:0 "The Center-left is still the left!"
EGY.3.b:0 "They would only undermine the revolution."

EGY.4.t:0 "Weapon Stockpile Discovered in Idlib"
EGY.4.d:0 "A stockpile of rifles, grenades, and ammunition was found beneath a prominent cafe in the center of Idlib. Our current working theory is that this stockpile is part of a larger network of anarchist sleeper cells organizing for some sort of revolution.The make and model of the guns suggests various origins and look as if they came from Egyptian, Russian, French, British, and even Swedish manufacturers. It’s clear that this is only the tip of the iceberg, but the Gendarmerie are wary of letting the story get out in fear of it causing panic and that it might give these plotters time to cover up their tracks, destroy evidence, and evade justice."
EGY.4.a:0 "This must remain Top Secret!"

EGY.5.t:0 "The Story Leaks!"
EGY.5.d:0 "Despite the best efforts of our gendarmerie to keep the news of the weapon stockpile a secret, somehow the public has discovered about it. The leak has caused widespread panic and allowed for the plotters, whoever they may be, to cover their tracks and remain undetected."
EGY.5.a:0 "Someone will be shot for this!"

EGY.6.t:0 "The Story Stays Hidden"
EGY.6.d:0 ""
EGY.6.a:0 "Less headaches, thankfully."

EGY_civilwar.1.t:0 "Riots in Damascus"
EGY_civilwar.1.d:0 "In protest to the increasing expansion and militarization of the Gendarmes as well as the arrest of numerous local community and labor leaders has sparked a general strike in Damascus. Since then, the strike has only gotten worse and has devolved into more of a riot. The dissidents seem highly organized and they have begun building barricades and distributing weapons in the city, according to some inside reports. The dissidents, waving red flags and accompanied by various union leaders and politicians, have even begun firing on the city hall. Only the army can quell this, but our forces are stretched very thin right now and we have only one available military unit nearby, the Deir Ez Zor army led by General Gamal Abdel Nasser."
EGY_civilwar.1.a:0 "A long shot, but He's the only hope we have."

EGY_civilwar.2.t:0 "Nasser Negotiates"
EGY_civilwar.2.d:0 "Gamal Abdel Nasser, a general and member of the moderate leftist Arab Socialist Party, was sent in from guarding the northern border to “deal” with the riots in Damascus. Although usual protocol for civil unrest like this is to arrest the leaders and enforce martial law in the city, Nasser has decided to negotiate with the rioters and see if their demands could be met peacefully. Our intelligence agents suggest that Nasser, who is sympathetic to the rioters, will be a biased negotiator and may even already be working with the rebels. They suggest that we should give Nasser the explicit order to fire on the rebels and install martial law, then we can execute him if he disobeys."
EGY_civilwar.2.a:0 "Give Nasser the order to fire!"

EGY_civilwar.3.t:0 "Nasser Mutinies!"
EGY_civilwar.3.d:0 "Nasser has refused to obey our orders! A warrant for his execution has been issued and in response Nasser has declared that the rebels are a more legitimate and just government than us! His entire army has defected to their side. Michel Aflaq, who we have discovered to have been key in igniting and organizing the strikes, has held a meeting with Nasser and several other leftists in Damascus, declaring their independence from the “oppressive capitalist government of [Insert Leader Name] in Alexandria” as the United Arab Republic. Nasser has been appointed president of the republic and his troops now form its army. It is imperative that we crush this rebellion before it spreads to other parts of Egypt."
EGY_civilwar.3.a:0 "Crush these rebels!"
EGY_civilwar.3.b:0 "Down with the King!"

EGY_civilwar.4.t:0 "Revolts across Syria"
EGY_civilwar.4.d:0 "All across Syria, leftist militias have appeared seemingly out of nowhere. In reality, these dastardly reds had been organizing underground for quite some time. Egyptian factories have been overtaken by the trade unions, who have begun to run them themselves, and our military units in the area completely ignore our orders."
EGY_civilwar.4.a:0 "And Syria has fallen."

EGY_civilwar.5.t:0 "Nationwide Strikes!"
EGY_civilwar.5.d:0 "Trade unions and workers across the nation have decided to strike against the Egyptian government in an act of defiance against the government’s increasingly repressive policies as well as its attempt to ban the Arab Socialist Party. Both the government and various corporations have teamed up in an attempt to break the strikes through the use of police and the gendarmerie."
EGY_civilwar.5.a:0 "By Allah!"

EGY_civilwar.6.t:0 "Martial Law Across Egypt!"
EGY_civilwar.6.d:0 "In response to the widespread revolts and unrest plaguing our nation, the parliament, which now composed only of pro-government moderates, has voted unanimously to declare martial law and to form a temporary military government until democracy can safely be restored."
EGY_civilwar.6.a:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures."

EGY_civilwar.7.t:0 "Rise of the Brotherhood"
EGY_civilwar.7.d:0 "After news of Nasser’s mutiny and nationwide strikes, Hassan al-Banna’s booming voice echoed over a crowd of thousands of enthusiastic supporters.  “Brothers and Sisters, the time for peaceful jihad has ended. For long enough have we merely spread the word and practiced charity. Now, as the forces of the United Arab Republic seek to wipe out the glorious culture of the Darul al-Islam and return us to Jahiliyyah (the time of ignorance) with their so-called “secularism”. These socialists, many of whom are not even sunni, seek to impose their godless ways on the Ummah and to extinguish our spirit, our culture, and our land. The King in Alexandria is nothing but corrupt and impious while his ministers who are supposed to balance his power are an even greater evil; many of them treat Farouk like a pharoah and wish to return to a time of slavery and Jahilliyah - the age of ignorance! The time has come for a Jihad not merely of the heart, but of the sword! We must defend our faith and defend our lands! To the whole of the Umma, no matter your sect or school, we need you! Rise up!”. Many important figures across Egypt and beyond have heard this call for Jihad, like the King of Darfur, who had long resented Egyptian domination; Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi, whose grandfather led the Mahdist rebellion against the British and Egyptians; and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a veteran of the Great Levantine War and prominent traditionalist and nationalist figure. The authority of the Mahdi and Darfuri King has given the Brotherhood control over much of Sudan, while pious muslims take to the streets across the country and form brigades of Mujahedin. Even the anti-communist and islamic corporatist Young Egypt movement led by al-Qayim Ahmed Husayn has moblized in the streets in support of the Muslim Brotherhood and backed by the wealthy Ibrahim Shoukry."
EGY_civilwar.7.a:0 "Inshallah!"
EGY_civilwar.7.b:0 "Why don’t you keep your faith to yourself?"

EGY_civilwar.8.t:0 "Emergency in the Equatoria Governorate"
EGY_civilwar.8.d:0 "As chaos has engulfed much of the Sudan, the autonomous Equatoria governorate has been cut off from the central government. The mostly christian governorate has been become extremely frenzied as they fear that they will be slaughtered by the Muslim Brotherhood. We have advised the Equatoria Corps, an elite military unit responsible for defending our southernmost territory, to establish a military government on its own with the collaboration of local government officials in order to preserve law and order. Chief inspector of the Juba Police and leader of the Equatoria Corps, Gordon Muortat-Mayen, has taken control of the governorate as provisional leader."
EGY_civilwar.8.a:0 "We must defend Equatoria."
EGY_civilwar.8.b:0 "The central government is more important."

EGY_civilwar.9.t:0 "The Blueshirts Are On the March"
EGY_civilwar.9.d:0 "The Umma Party leadership has decided to invest more in the party’s youth wing, the Blue Shirts. Much smaller in size than both the socialist and islamist youth groups, the blueshirts often lose the street confrontations they have with rival groups and need to be bulked up in order to be a viable force in swaying the youth to our side. As our police forces grow increasingly strained, these Blue Shirts may become important in keeping law and order. The funds will largely go to recruitment campaigns and youth programs directed especially at the poorer areas of our cities, where anti-government sentiment is the highest."
EGY_civilwar.9.a:0 "They are the future."

EGY_resentful_lower_class_desc:0 "The vast lower class of Egypt, the proletariat and peasantry, have been neglected by Egypt’s thoroughly laissez-faire and liberal dominated government. The poor continue to suffer and grow resentful of the government."
EGY_the_aswan_dam:0 "The Aswan Dam"
EGY_the_aswan_dam_desc:0 "As part of Farouk’s grand reforms, most of which have failed or were never agreed upon by the parliament, the Egyptian government constructed one of the largest dams in the world to harness the power of the Nile river. However, the plan was criticized for the ecological damage it would do neighboring farmers. Then, it was opposed by the Dam workers themselves, whose wages were too low. Next thing you know, the entire city of Aswan had become the center of a popular uprising. Though the uprising was eventually crushed, the memories of the so-called “Dam War” are relevant in the popular memory as a symbol of the oppression caused by the King’s regime."
EGY_gilded_age:0 "Gilded Age"

EGY_peshmerga_raids:0 "Peshmerga Raids"
EGY_peshmerga_raids_desc:0 "Kurdish rebels known as the Peshmerga have been attacking our troops in the border regions between Egypt and Kurdistan. This has caused a demoralization of our troops in Syria, who have been fighting a series of pointless skirmishes against the Kurdish rebels before they retreat to Kurdistan. This has made relations with Kurdistan more tense as well."
