Politics could not advance.”\n\nThe wise words of Dr. Sun Yat-sen is heeded throughout his Kuomintang proteges– despite being called a Party-State where political power is safely (and most likely eternally) in the hands of the Kuomintang, a number of minor left-wing parties such as the Productive People’s Party or the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party are allowed to exist alongside as long as they follow the Kuomintang party-line and work within a coalition with the Kuomintang.§!\n"

NRC_Party_State:0 "Dang Guo"
NRC_Party_State_desc:0 "Dr. Sun Yat-sen laid out the Three Stages of Revolution, the national plan to transform China into a stable and united republic. The first stage is military reunification, when the revolutionary army takes primacy to wipe out the monarchist tyranny and the various illnesses that plague China. The second stage is that of political tutelage, when the Kuomintang party is empowered as the most superior power within the Republic. During this phase, an ideology is ennacted known as Dang Guo– or Party-State. The Kuomintang is to lead the state and instruct the people on how the democratic system is to work and prepare for the third stage, where constitutional government is to be introduced and the people will be able to directly exercise their political rights through the government.\n\nThe Kuomintang is still in the phase of military unification and is working with the provisional 1923 constitution written by Cao Kun. Democracy may seem like a far-flung dream for China, but much of the Kuomintang is still certain that one day it will come."
NRC_Wang_Jingwei_Thought:0 "Wang Jingwei Thought"
NRC_Wang_Jingwei_Thought_desc:0 "The various experiences of the late Chairman Wang Jingwei, be it while in socialist Paris, fighting in the disastrous Northern Expedition, or liberating Eastern China from traitors and imperialists has lead to the cultivation of a unique ideology known as Wang Jingwei Thought. A modernization of Sun Yat-Sen's ideology, Wang Jingwei Thought proposes that China must be liberated by a social and political revolution, and that the trust of the people needs to gained to prove that democratic republicanism will actually bring change to China. The old socio-economic order is to be destroyed as well. Economically, a top-down program of nationalization, land rent taxation, land expropriation, and foreign liquidation must be implemented. Socially, a modernized and humanist Chinese culture must be built over the old antiquated Confucian order. Wang Jingwei Thought is deeply entrenched in the politics of China, to the point where it may potentially trump the philosophies of Sun Yat-Sen."

POLITICS_CHEN_GONGBO_DESC:0 "§YChairman of the National Government of the Republic of China§!\n\nWhile false tyrants rule in the north, the south of China has been liberated– and who else but Chairman Chen to uphold the Three Principles of the People? Chen Gongbo upholds the legacies of Sun Yat-sen, Chaing Kai-shek, and Chairman Wang Jingwei, the three heroes of the Republic which he fights for.\n\nChen studied in Peking University before becoming a participant in the May Fourth Movement and as a student of Marxism became a subordinate of Chen Duxio’s Chinese Syndicalist Party. He left the party in 1921 and studied economics at Columbia University in the United States before returning to China and organizing with the Kuomintang. There he met Wang Jingwei, who he soon became close friends with. He held various high-ranking government ministries during the Northern Expedition, and fled to France with Wang Jingwei (now Chairman of the Kuomintang) during the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek’s government.\n\nWhen Chairman Wang made his return to China during the Lower Yangtze Expedition in 1936, Chen was besides him, and quickly became the Vice-Chairman of the Kuomintang. Chairman Wang passed away in 1949, after spending the last 10 years of his life uniting southern China. The Central Committee was quick to elect Chen as the new Chairman to continue his legacy.\n\nChairman Chen has large boots to fill. The Northern Government of the Republic is still fairly new, and has a myriad of obstacles that he must lead China to overcome. Can he finalize the movement that Sun Yat-sen started, and can he uphold Wang Jingwei Thought throughout the nation?"
