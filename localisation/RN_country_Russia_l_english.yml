rus.1.t:0 "Russia, We Greet You"
rus.1.d:0 "After the defeat of the perfidious Bolshevik hordes in 1920 it was hoped that the Russian people could finally rest easy. Yet fate had more in store, and history tends towards a twisted sense of humor. The Republican government that followed victory was a rotting house built upon a twisted structure. At its top was Kerensky, an ineffective figurehead who allowed ancestral lands to be sold away in the treaty of Brest Litovsk.Yet despite this state of affairs, all was not lost. Kerensky’s days became numbered following the 1924 Kolchak Putsch and the disastrous loss of Transamaur that followed. In secret, Russia's hero; Lavr Kornilov bided his time. He had defeated the Bolsheviks before, so again would he defeat the ineffectual puppets in the Duma.\n\nIn 1936, the inevitable day arrived. Before Kerensky’s body had even been recovered from the senate steps, swift plans were sprung into motion. In Saratov the Sons of the Motherland mobilised, eager at the chance to finally save the people from themselves. Had they refused to act, there would have been no telling who the democrats and their masonic handlers would have appointed.It was Kornilov who returned glory to the land, Kornilov who defeated the Hun, Kornilov who  united the race, and Kornilov who established the five headed regime. Russia was strong again, proud and free! The people rejoiced and praised the efforts of their Vozhd. Yet With his holy duty finished, the Vohzd traveled skywards, ready to dispense his foes on the astral plane.\n\nnToday a new face rules; Nikolai Skoblin, a man who by all accounts does not fill his predecessors shoes. Ruling with a mix of guile and nostalgia, his faction of Young Kornilovites is dually led by Mikhail Levitov, Skoblin’s deputy and right hand. Together they have sought to fulfill the vision of the great hero who came before, sticking closely, if unimaginatively, to his teachings. Dark forces brew beneath the surface. With each passing day, the “Loyal” minorities grow increasingly discontent and the Eurasianists, Illyinists, and the Black Hundreds plot to reshape the nation in their image. Without the guiding hand of its paternal father disorder has begun to rear its ugly head yet again. Should the National-State fail, the world will be left to the decadent socialists.  May god help Russia, for no-one else will..."

rus.12.t:0 "Ukraine Revolt"
rus.12.d:0 "Reports of traitorous towns on the periphery of Russian controlled Ukraine and sporadic shootings at farmsteads have been building steadily as of late,  despite our extensive state censorship efforts. However, it appears now the dam has officially broken, and the scale of the situation is truly staggering.\n\nIt appears a full scale revolt is currently underway across Eastern Ukraine, threatening the city of Kiev itself! Frenzied troop deployments and panicked Gopnik detachtments have been deployed to the Ukraine.\n\nA certain previously obscure group known as the/ "Ukranian Revolutionary Army/" led by the so-called \"Gentleman General\" Andriy Melnyk with its root in the old regime military seems to be the chief conspirators behind this treasonous affair."

rus.13.t:0 "Finland Revolt"
rus.13.d:0 "Startling news from Finland reported a mass armed insurrection is currently underway. While still somewhat distant from Helsinki, the strength of the revolt means it could quite easily reach the city soon. An organization known as the "Finnish Secret Army" composed of remaining generals of the old armed forces and connected to the old exile government in Norway is reportedly leading the charge.Lkely inspired by similar developments in Ukraine, and  feeding upon the resentment of the native people. As officials communiqué intercepted by the TaGoP sounded the alarm in Moscow.\n\n/"People of Finland, your armed forces never surrendered! We have bided our time, and now we ask your help. The homeland calls upon all patriots to rise in struggle one last time./""

rus.14.t:0 "Levitvo's Anger"
rus.14.d:0 "Levitov travelled with superhuman speed across the elongated halls of the Kremlin, propelled by fury. At his side stood several officers, each one struggling to maintain their disciplined stance while keeping pace with the general. Levitov slammed his shoulder against the hardwood, straining the tired hinges. The guards simply looked on in astonishment.\n\n"Nikolai Vladimirovich! You cowardly dog! Had a look out the window lately? Or shall I have to do that for you as well?"\n\nSkoblin's confusion turned to anger matching the general's. He stood up from his desk chair, assumed a confident posture, and retorted.\n\n"Calm yourself Mikhail! I have afforded you many privileges, but insubordination was not one of them! I am your Vohzd!"\n\nLevitov broke into boisterous laughter at the assertion, amused at the palpable irony that pervaded the air. He had just returned from Kiev, where the fruits of Skoblin's labour could be seen in the burning buildings and wounded soldiers. He took a deep breath, and stared at his old friend. Suddenly he realized the futility of this endeavor. In the office of the Vozhd, there could be no room for weakness or petty outburst. It was a cold determination that Kornilov had harnessed to save Russia once before, and so it would be again. One thing had become abundantly clear, the lazy rot that affected all bureaucrats had spread to his old friend." 
rus.14.a:0 "What might that man be up to"
rus.15.t:0 "A Speech before the Duma"
rus.15.d:0 ""Representatives of the Duma, Sons and Daughter of Russia, in light of my service to the motherland, I ask only that you grant me your ear in our hour of need. I will mince no words"\n\n"Russia is dying. Across the breadth of our motherland, subterfuge and sabotage undermine our great experiment. Our once loyal minorities, weak at heart, have yet again been poisoned by foreign ideologies and cowardly sentiments. These are the facts, laid bare for all to see by recent events."\n\n"Brave Patriot Knights; brothers in arms who struggle valiantly against the monstrous hordes that would doom the world to bolshevism, are currently deployed across our peripheries. I myself, as you know, have led them."\n\n"A great betrayal is afoot, within the highest levels of our government. In the office of great men, today sits a coward. A miserable wretch lurks the halls of the Kremlin, growing fat off the toil of our countrymen, sitting content as the apocalypse batters down our door."\n\n"Brothers, I ask you to assist me in my aims. We must remove this treasnonous excuse for a Vohzd at all costs. I seek not personal glory, but only the salvation of Russia, and Indeed all humanity. The hour of decision is at hand. Who will join me?"

rus.16.t:0 "Arrest of Levitov"
rus.16.d:0 "In the fallout of massive revolts across the periphery of the Russian State, uprisings which seem to grow more dire with each passing day, a great drama is unfolding within the streets of Moscow.In the dog eat dog, darwinian game that is Russian politics, General Mikhail Levitov has initiated a bold operation. A longtime political ally of the current vozhd;  Nikolai Vladimirovich Skoblin, Levitov has begun openly calling for the leader's resignation. Besides general derision, Levitov has  cited inadequate response to the uprisings and general cowardice in fulfillment of his duty. Of course such a treasonous declaration from a once beloved general sent shockwaves through Russia, and the secret police were swiftly mobilised to arrest Levitov.\n\nAs the dust settles, one thing has become clear; Levitov has weathered the storm. It seems his sentiments were wider spread then previously known, and combined with his legendary image, the ambitious general has managed to convert the Black and Reds to his cause. Now, the Vohzd will surely have to fear his own arrest. Meanwhile, the military itself has remained neutral, despite large sympathies towards Levitov, on account of the ongoing revolts."

While many sympathisers remain in the army, any challenge to Vohzd's authority is over, and the traitor will be punished in due time."

rus.18.t:0 "Wrangel returned!"
rus.18.d:0 "As old allies Levitov and Skoblin tear each other apart in a foolish, chest thumping duel, a single man watches from the shadows, gathering strength. Long has he waited for a moment such as this. A moment when the young Kornilovites might be distracted, surely an inevitability considering the breadth of their ego.Since 1948, when the father of our nation; Lavr Kornilov passed away, he has been forced underground. As the old Vohzd's most loyal allies were replaced or exiled, Pyotor Wrangel grew quiet, seemingly tired by such a brazen display of opportunism and youthful folly.Now, he has returned. Around him gathers a party of the alienated; military officers who tire of the spectacle, old guard remnants and prominent whites. In Levitov's quest to depose a "weak" Vohzd, he has exposed his own weakness and  treasonous ambition.\n\nToday, the party marched on Moscow, and with the backing of the military following Levitov's failed stunt, forced Skoblin to resign. With the twin ingrates defeated, the old order has returned to Russia. Vohzd Wrangel will  restore the nation to its rightful path, draft policies to placate the people, and ensure revolts such as these never occur again. The great reckoning is at hand, may all traitors beware!"

rus.28.d:0 "The incompetent fools of the ministry have petitioned Moscow today. They claim that in spite of “extraordinary heroism” from our occupation forces, they have failed to suppress the Finnish rebellion that has been ongoing for almost half a year.\n\n Though it is humiliating we have made arrangements to meet the enemy in Warsaw. It appears that unlike the Governor-General, they are sensible. Aware that their so-called “secret army” can not hold out against us forever, they have dictated terms. \n\nAmong these terms are the restoration of an independent constitution, parliament, and a domestic leader rather than a Ministry bureaucrat.\n\n General Levitov has strongly opposed concessions of any kind. In his view, such a deal would be “independence in all but name” and would “provide a bolshevik foothold on our border.” He also believes the rebellion to be losing steam. Instead, Levitov has requested a full invasion of Finland by the northwest armed forces.\n\nNaturally, the political consequences of raising several field armies to fight a rebellion that we have repeatedly denied the existence of would be dire. A true war against the Finnish population could end up being quite the bloody affair, not to mention the hit to our international image. Then again, conceding to the bastards may be just as destructive an act.\n\n Shall we accept peace?"

Sensing blood in the water, a group calling themselves the "League of Freedom Fighters of Estonia" has overwhelmed the scantly equipped police forces of the city, declaring a free state!\n\nWe must crush the bastards quickly before they can march on the other baltic states, or worse, connect with the Finnish rebels in the north.

They harnessed his weakness and weakness, using them in a revolt reminiscent of 1917!\n\nYet the destiny of the Slavic people stands indefatigable, and Russia still holds many brave patriot knights among its citizenry.  The new governor general Shatilov has triumphed over the bastards!

rus.60.d:0 "The History of the Transamur region is one of treachery and betrayal. It is a land deprived of rightful honor and stolen first by a traitorous charlatan; Alexander Kolchack. His opportunistic megalomania was only rivaled by his incompetence, which led to rightful ejection at the hands of his own ministers and the people.\n\nSadly, as what remained of the local administration began operations to reunite with the motherland they were foiled. Kolhack’s Japanese handlers moved too swiftly and Vladivostok was stolen yet again, this time by conniving foreigners. In what would come to be known as the 1946 “Second Amur Incident” Russian troops were stopped before they could cross the border and all loyal formations in the city found themselves arrested in their barracks.\n\nSince then Transamur has remained a black stain on an otherwise spotless reputation. It is the greatest humiliation that the land was not reclaimed when the Vohzd drew breath. Internal turmoil has prevented us from correcting this injustice in the past, yet it shall no longer! The population of the region has been openly hostile to their occupiers since our stirring victory in the Great Patriotic War.

rus.61.d:0 "In our quest to free the Asian people from the noxious influence of western imperialism, we have encountered yet another obstacle. The Transamaur region, seized for the emperor in our dealings with the mad Admiral Kolchack, has devolved into riots and protests. Reports of flaming barracks and ransacked dockyards are spiraling out of control and the administrative commission in Vladivostok is urgently requesting reinforcements.\n\nThe slavic ingrates who co-inhabit the region with our native citizens have always been resentful of our influence. Yet what was once a nuisance has become shockingly disruptive. Perhaps they are simply reacting to the recent wartime triumph of their native land, or perhaps these events are simply inevitable when dealing with such an uncouth people.\n\nRegardless, the Russian government has once before attempted to seize the region from us.The situation must be handled swiftly and harshly, so as not to display weakness. We will not allow the imperialists another opportunity!"

Photos of buildings burning in the countryside and Vladivostok city police scurrying like rats have begun pouring into the media. We must decide our next move, for the dominoes are falling and the opportunity is both lucrative and time sensitive.\n\nTwo options have been presented, and both the TaGop and the Army have been bickering regarding each option’s feasibility or lack thereof.\n\nThe first scenario is more restrained yet likely highly effective. It involves the deployment of several squads; highly armed and professionally trained TaGOP agents who would assault key points. These squads would work under plausible deniability, allowing the rioters to fully seize the region and providing us with a preRUSt to step in and “Restore Order”.\n\nThe second scenario is certainly bold and fittingly swift, however it may be heavy handed. The army is advocating a mass infiltration operation under the cover of night. Then when the moment is right our soldiers would spring into action. With the Japanese already given a bloody nose by the insurrectionary rioters, surely the overwhelming intervention of our soldiers would force the Japanese into a full withdrawal?\n\nThe window of opportunity grows smaller.

Behind its wheel sat Mr. Nakamura, a parent fearfully ferrying his pregnant wife and small child. Eager to escape the chaos in the city center, they sped off through old dirt roads towards the neighboring towns. It was by sheer chance that the worn vehicle blew its tire in the marshlands, and even less likely that his child spotted an errant flashlight in the treeline. Yet both events occurred, and when the family arrived at their destination Mr. Nakamura provided an eager retelling to any Japanese official who would listen.\n\nAmelin and his brothers would never reach Khavarovsk.\n\nInstead,  the future Amelin would find himself gurgling in the dirt and blood as he lay motionless towards the starry sky. His state of calm giving way to animalistic panic, he turned to see Agent Drugov; his head covered by a black bag and his wrists cuffed behind his back.\n\n“Fuck..” he would whisper dejectedly.

They carried professional weaponry, were outfitted in tactical gear and behaved as if they were a cohesive fireteam. Though they had no uniforms and have thus far refused to provide any information regarding their motives it is unquestionable that these were not simply members of the rabble. Considering these factors as well as their location close to the border, it seems highly likely that the men are servants of the Russian government.\n\nMilitary reinforcements have been authorised in the northern reaches of Transamur following the incident and existing police patrols have been placed on even higher alert.

The hike was peaceful for the most part. Naught could be heard early on save the crushing of twigs underfoot and the crackle of fallen leaves. It was not till they hit marshland that trouble arose; a family of Japanese colonisers repairing their flat tire.  Agent Amelin switched off his flashlight worriedly, though thankfully none of his comrades were spotted. It was on this leg of the journey that he suppressed the tiniest nugget of rage towards the family he eyed from a safe distance. They were foreign bastards, outright thieving the spiritual territory of his people! He forced the thought to fade, bringing his mind to the mission yet again.\n\nFinally they reached the outskirts of the city and the air sat thick with smoke. A post office served as both a mass changing room and a forward operating base. After swapping for civilian clothes, Agent Amelin turned towards the large table that had been pulled to the room's center by Agent Drugov. Upon it sat Pamphlets, Posters, Letters.

He gambled on the fact that the Russians believed us unaware of their actions, a gamble that turned out to be successful. Infiltrating Russian troops were first engaged near Khabarovsk, then swiftly encircled as they retreated homewards.\n\nDespite our inferior numbers we have managed to wipe out their entire expeditionary force!

If none of them could hit a target past eight feet away, what chance did they have against the Japanese?\n\nIt had all gone to shit hours ago, though it felt like years.They were merely a mile past the border. Konstantin had actually been excited to do his part in liberating Transamur. The plan was to infiltrate the city and coordinate with the local insurrection.

Instead they found a fortified countryside with heavy machine gun emplacements and cloaked snipers in the trees. They hadn't stood a chance, and were lucky to get out alive.Now they were returning home as fast as they could, fully aware that being so deep in enemy territory made an encirclement likely.

His superior descended upon the man almost instantly, ready to dispense justice. Konstantin grew angry at the sight, and immediately regretted having shouted himself. Yet punishment would not come to him, for his punishment was much greater.\n\nThe clearing erupted with a hail of blood, bullets, and a single futile shotgun blast. Then, as quickly as the carnage began it was over. Konstantin’s last sight would be his own ripped up guts spilling out, and his last thoughts were of humiliation."

rus.72.d:0 "The Marshal knelt in front of the altar, holding the cross as he muttered under his breath. He paraphrased a poem written by Turgenev, he twisted its hostility and apathy to Holy Russia into an evocation, scathing and sorrowful in meaning.\n\n"In these times of doubt, in these days of painful brooding over the fate of my country, thou alone art my rod and sceptre, O great, mighty, true and free Russia - one and indivisible, holy and radiant. Thou art my comfort and my goal, my dream and my wish. Thou alone art my master... thou alone."\n\nThe Marshal's mind wandered to the Great War, fighting against the Germans, leading the legions of Holy Russia, pushing westwards and stamping his feet triumphantly in Berlin. He remembered the days where he - Petr Nikolaevich - and Kornilov - that magnificent bastard - stood side by side, parading the gallant youths that had sacrificed so much for a hard-earned victory. But now, Russia has grown corrupt. As Kornilov departed to another, more peaceful realm, the nation nudged further and further towards a more selfish and egoistical form. The Young Kornilovites! How dare they call themselves that! Russia weakens, and rifts in society can be seen left and right. How long would it take for the Vozhd to see?! As the service continued, Vrangel found himself muttering the same words over and over again..."

rus.78.d:0 "Skoblin cried out for the guards to secure his way out of the Kremlin, yet to no avail. Meanwhile, Levitov just sat in his chair, accepting his fate without even a semblance of struggle. Minutes ago they were shouting at each other, funnily enough. They heard a loud bang as the door was thrown open by black-clad soldiers, holding rifles in their hand. After them came another man, this time tall and wearing a black cossack outfit - a sight that everyone would recognize as the very elderly and very annoyed Black Baron. Somewhat notably enough, he was flanked by a bespectacled man, Mikhail Drozdovsky.\n\n'Nikolai Vladimirovich, Mikhail Nikolaevich, I've heard that there's some sort of a dispute between you two." Said Wrangel with a tiny sliver of an attempt of cruel sarcasm. "I think it's up to us to arbitrate between you two young'uns." Said Wrangel as he walked into the middle of the room with his forces. Skoblin immediately leaned to the wall as a sudden feeling of weakness struck him.\n\n"If you two want power so much...so be it. Perhaps neither of you deserve it." Wrangel threw a small object into the table, prompting a flinch from Levitov and a shudder from Skoblin - half the room away. It was a pen. "We've.. agreed," Wrangel nodded towards Drozdovsky before continuing, "That the Army has a basis for removing you two from your seats, and that it's the best course of action to save Holy Russia. Now, go on - sign here and here." Skoblin and Levitov both begrudgingly signed the documents - it was two separate letters of resignation. Then, after a short vote, Wrangel was elected as Vozhd and Drozdovsky as his deputy Vozhd. Behind closed doors, Russia's two strongest figures were removed from politics with little to no violence, or perharps not yet."

One such enemy however, came from within. Wrangel and Drozdovodogsky, delusional in their worship of our failed imperial past struck us in our hour of need. As the radios squawked and the telephone operators found themselves helpless, all seemed lost. \n\n It was in Saratov where we made our stand.  With backs to the trains and eyes to the River, our tired eyed men gathered for a last stand against the servants of those inbred cowards. With bullet and bomb, our future was decided; evolution or regression?\n\nAs the air grows quiet, and the sobbing stops, a sigh of relief is held. Then, joy grows in increasing tempo.

rus.77.d:0 "This must have been how Raskolnikov felt, thought General Krakovetsky bemusedly. The murder of a simple pawnbroker generating a cascade of events. What that protagonist had started seemed to find no end. One crime became two, two became three, and three became an escalating series of desperate cover ups and almost admissions.\n\n“Ah fuck” he thought as he returned from daydream “When one finds himself in a river, of what use is resisting the current?”\n\nWhile some parts of that tale appealed to the General however, he had committed no crime. Instead, his heart fluttered with excitement. Atop a horse before columns of soldiers, he had entered the outskirts of the city. Cheering crowds awaited them, a gathering of the dispossessed turned hopeful.\n\nThe great Russian game, sparked in 1919 by that damned Vladimir Ilyich was coming to a swift end. With their victory in Saratov, no forces remained to delay the inevitable. As the crowds sang and impulsive soldiers bought flowers to place within their barrels the General grinned. Sanity and compassion, thought lost to the historical tide, had triumphed!\n\nSome time later, the men reached the City center. Thick doors were thrust open with a cheer and each room secured. To the horror of the Kornilovist envo, “Hail Russia” or “Hail the Vozhd” were not heard. Instead, Krakovetsky’s voice took an unexpected turn.\n\n“Demagogues be damned!” boomed the General to his comrades “Today is a victory for the people!”"

rus.79.t:0 "Sleepless Moscow"
rus.79.d:0 "In a small building with a metal peak upon its top stood five men, two hostages, and a corpse. They leaned across a table in the glow of pale fluorescent, a hue only slightly warmer than the cold night outside. A quiet tension reigned in all present, something they shared with the city below.\n\nThe first of the five held his gun towards the corner, where the hostages sat dejected. The second fiddled anxiously, an intense fellow who was failing to wrangle sound from the complex radio equipment. The third placed the record upon the player, and stood impatiently with needle in hand.\n\nFinally, after a bit more fiddling the second man relaxed. His stern face became a smile, and he nodded to the needle-keeper. It was another moment before the scratchiness faded, and then, in an event that defied the cold winds and the frightful hostages came sound. Slow at first, then louder.\n\nAcross the city of Moscow that night the people stirred in their slumber. Windows cautiously opened, the destitute froze in place, and the soldiers looked up. The soft words were beautiful, no matter what future they signified.\n\nIn both the radio tower and the city below, scattered voices sang that well known tune. "

rus.81.t:0 "Propaganda appears in Transamur!"
rus.81.d:0 "The riots gripping Transamur seem to have taken on yet another new dimension! In towns and cities across the region, under the cover of night, a propaganda distribution network seems to have developed spontaneously. Leaflets can be found in the hands of the people everywhere, as well as matted wet in the gutters and blowing down the streets in the wind. In addition, Posters are observable in many alleyways and on every lamppost.\n\nSlogans from these propaganda pieces have begun to filter into the regular protest chants, as have wild rumours regarding the massacre of children and even local officials! At one point a minister named Sergei Antonov in Vladivostok had to make several public appearances following the publishing of a pamphlet claiming him to be dead; executed at the hands of our police forces!\n\nYet as absurd as the propaganda is there is no denying its effectiveness. Any hopes that the riots were ceasing have died, and the police are continuing to struggle with the now nightly unruliness across the region."

rus.82.t:0 "The Power of Words"
rus.82.d:0 "Pavel limped through the door, let out a deep sigh, and collapsed backwards into his favorite chair. His mother was asleep in the next room and he was sure she had heard him enter. When she did not emerge from her slumber, Pavel felt a slight guilt. Today was the third day in a row he had gone “protesting” with his coworkers at the dockyards. Each time Pavel was disobeying her; that underpaid woman who sought only to protect their family. He understood her reluctance. Government reprisal descending upon their tiny apartment was the last thing baby Isaak needed.\n\nWhat she didn't understand was that he was protecting Isaak too. It was true Pavel held his own righteous fury at the Japanese, however he was not merely selfish. The real origin of all his actions was hope. He hoped desperately that the future might be better for his little brother, for he could not bear to see that child grow up under foreign domination when they were so close to the Motherland’s border.\n\nIsaak shook his head dejectedly. It was the third night in a row, his bones ached and his muscles cried out as a result of his earlier flight from the police, and he was exhausted. They had all chanted slogans, organised rallies  and thrown bricks through windows. He had even encountered men with rifles firing towards their occupiers. A sinking feeling gripped him as his early tenacity wavered. How could such a disorganized movement triumph over the Japanese? The people held so much rage in their hearts and yet it had only been expressed in a chaotic frenzy.\n\nHe stood up stiffly and grunted despite his body demanding sleep. Pavel needed to clear his head, so the scarf slipped back on and he descended the steps. However, just as he was going to turn towards the exterior door a leaflet caught his eye. He turned it in his palm and opened the folds. Inside, in bold RUSt was the word “MURDERERS!” accompanied by a picture of the local minister Sergei Antonov. He devoured the words, hearing the tale of brutal savagery inflicted upon the poor Russian. Suddenly the tiredness and aches were gone. He glanced at the clock upon the wall above him and squinted his eyes.\n\nFor Sergei, Pavel could afford a few more hours at the dockyard."

rus.85.d:0 "The Razor’s gash went deep, drawing bright red fluid from Dimitri’s chin. It ran like water upon glass and dribbled to the floor. Dimitri didn’t even notice. Two fists gripped the sides of the sink and wide eyes stared ahead in the mirror. In the background he heard the shouts and cries. He had no doubt of the scene’s carnage. He guessed half of the men were praying and the other half was beating those that were for cowardice. They hadn’t even reached the front yet and men were probably dead.\n\nHalf shaven but finally aware Dimitri ran from the bathroom to confirm his suspicions. The Barracks was empty save a single sleeping man. Dimitri thought of waking him before deciding against it. If it was really happening, best he stayed that way.\n\nOutside now. The Officers were pounding upon the headquarters of their superior a few meters away. A particularly angry one could be heard yelling even from where he stood. \n\n“You said our progress had been swift enough!”\n\nHis eyes turned from the officer to the sky and felt surreal as the streak made its long arc. His terror was replaced with laughter. It had only taken seconds for every aspiration to vanish. Memento Mori.\n\nHis pupils burned in an instant, alongside the rest of St.Petersburg."

rus.90.d:0 "Wrangel sighed, rubbed his temples, and quietly chuckled. Looking at the big picture, it really was quite funny in that absurd sort of way. He let the telephone drop to the desk, dial tone and all. He had thought the madness was over, that God’s toying had ceased. It had been his duty to seize Russia from those spoiled children, pretenders who let the nation fall to anarchy in the interest of saving their own skin. The leader of Russia rarely held the same face for long, and he intended to stabilise it.\n\n Now as the footsteps in the hallway grew louder and louder, he realised it had all been for nothing. Drozdovsky was himself but a foolish child despite his advanced age. Pytor was the only adult left in Russia. Though he knew it sinful, in such a moment, he thought only of retiring to his dacha. “You Win” he said cynically with an added “screeching brats” under his breath.\n\n The doors opened on cue, and with them came the pointed barrels. He addressed Drozdovodgosky only, the apathy obvious in his voice.\n\n “Tell me Mikhail Gordeevich, was it the land reform or the proposed constitution?”\n\n Pyotr left before truly receiving an answer, confident his days were numbered. It seemed Drozdovsky was more nostalgic than he had previously thought.. All the carnage since 1914 would now be entirely pointless; a cosmic joke. Absolute Czarism had returned from  hiatus, and Wrangel could not bear it, god forgive him."

rus.100.d:0 "“Sir, please confirm that order”\n\nThe General hated everything about it. He sat in a tomb, a sprawling mess of bulkheads and dimly lit tunnels full of stale air. Above was the dredging of barbarous hordes, hordes that held once great cities like Berlin, Paris, and Rome in their grip. His family was among the throng of citizens soon to be subjected to their whims. How he longed for elsewhere, to be fighting valiantly with rifle in hand while clearing a path for his wife and children. That was how men lived. Men were not rats who cowered in sewer systems.\n\n“Confirmed. You are to initiate the launch sequence” he spoke firmly.\n\n“Roger that sir. Sequence started.” \n\nThe General rubbed his eyes wearily while awaiting the opportunity to begin the next step. The whole thing made no damn sense with the enemy at the gates. Troops were made to obey orders and one order was all it should have taken.\n\n The inexplicable sense that eyes were upon him suddenly dawned again. The General slightly corrected his posture and glanced around the room. It's center consisted of a long circular table filled by men with little steel pins across their breast. Of all those men, he had the “honor” of answering the phone.\n\nAt the other end was the Vohzd, a towering figure who had become somewhat human in the last few hours spent caged together. The General hadn’t lost any respect for his leader though, In fact it had doubled. To see that such vision was capable of being carried out by a mere mortal was an inspiring thought.\in\nHis eyes glanced towards the stooge to his right, the one who seemed to be having trouble lighting a cigarette. It was shaky hands, badly concealed. The General wanted to laugh but stifled it before offering a light."
