rus.12.t:0 "Ukraine Revolt"
rus.12.d:0 "Reports of traitorous towns on the periphery of Russian controlled Ukraine and sporadic shootings at farmsteads have been building steadily as of late,  despite our extensive state censorship efforts. However, it appears now the dam has officially broken, and the scale of the situation is truly staggering.\n\nIt appears a full scale revolt is currently underway across Eastern Ukraine, threatening the city of Kiev itself! Frenzied troop deployments and panicked Gopnik detachtments have been deployed to the Ukraine.\n\nA certain previously obscure group known as the/ "Ukranian Revolutionary Army/" led by the so-called \"Gentleman General\" Andriy Melnyk with its root in the old regime military seems to be the chief conspirators behind this treasonous affair."
rus.12.a:0 "No mercy for the traitors"
rus.13.t:0 "Finland Revolt"
rus.13.d:0 "Startling news from Finland reported a mass armed insurrection is currently underway. While still somewhat distant from Helsinki, the strength of the revolt means it could quite easily reach the city soon. An organization known as the "Finnish Secret Army" composed of remaining generals of the old armed forces and connected to the old exile government in Norway is reportedly leading the charge.Lkely inspired by similar developments in Ukraine, and  feeding upon the resentment of the native people. As officials communiqué intercepted by the TaGoP sounded the alarm in Moscow.\n\n/"People of Finland, your armed forces never surrendered! We have bided our time, and now we ask your help. The homeland calls upon all patriots to rise in struggle one last time./""
rus.13.a:0 "Recalls the Army of Prussia immediately" 
rus.14.t:0 "Levitvo's Anger"
rus.14.d:0 "Levitov travelled with superhuman speed across the elongated halls of the Kremlin, propelled by fury. At his side stood several officers, each one struggling to maintain their disciplined stance while keeping pace with the general. Levitov slammed his shoulder against the hardwood, straining the tired hinges. The guards simply looked on in astonishment.\n\n"Nikolai Vladimirovich! You cowardly dog! Had a look out the window lately? Or shall I have to do that for you as well?"\n\nSkoblin's confusion turned to anger matching the general's. He stood up from his desk chair, assumed a confident posture, and retorted.\n\n"Calm yourself Mikhail! I have afforded you many privileges, but insubordination was not one of them! I am your Vohzd!"\n\nLevitov broke into boisterous laughter at the assertion, amused at the palpable irony that pervaded the air. He had just returned from Kiev, where the fruits of Skoblin's labour could be seen in the burning buildings and wounded soldiers. He took a deep breath, and stared at his old friend. Suddenly he realized the futility of this endeavor. In the office of the Vozhd, there could be no room for weakness or petty outburst. It was a cold determination that Kornilov had harnessed to save Russia once before, and so it would be again. One thing had become abundantly clear, the lazy rot that affected all bureaucrats had spread to his old friend." 
rus.14.a:0 "What might that man be up to"
rus.15.t:0 "A Speech before the Duma"
rus.15.d:0 ""Representatives of the Duma, Sons and Daughter of Russia, in light of my service to the motherland, I ask only that you grant me your ear in our hour of need. I will mince no words"\n\n"Russia is dying. Across the breadth of our motherland, subterfuge and sabotage undermine our great experiment. Our once loyal minorities, weak at heart, have yet again been poisoned by foreign ideologies and cowardly sentiments. These are the facts, laid bare for all to see by recent events."\n\n"Brave Patriot Knights; brothers in arms who struggle valiantly against the monstrous hordes that would doom the world to bolshevism, are currently deployed across our peripheries. I myself, as you know, have led them."\n\n"A great betrayal is afoot, within the highest levels of our government. In the office of great men, today sits a coward. A miserable wretch lurks the halls of the Kremlin, growing fat off the toil of our countrymen, sitting content as the apocalypse batters down our door."\n\n"Brothers, I ask you to assist me in my aims. We must remove this treasnonous excuse for a Vohzd at all costs. I seek not personal glory, but only the salvation of Russia, and Indeed all humanity. The hour of decision is at hand. Who will join me?"
rus.15.a:0 "Arrest him"
rus.15.b:0 "What have gotten to you, Mikhail"
rus.16.t:0 "Arrest of Levitov"
rus.16.d:0 "In the fallout of massive revolts across the periphery of the Russian State, uprisings which seem to grow more dire with each passing day, a great drama is unfolding within the streets of Moscow.In the dog eat dog, darwinian game that is Russian politics, General Mikhail Levitov has initiated a bold operation. A longtime political ally of the current vozhd;  Nikolai Vladimirovich Skoblin, Levitov has begun openly calling for the leader's resignation. Besides general derision, Levitov has  cited inadequate response to the uprisings and general cowardice in fulfillment of his duty. Of course such a treasonous declaration from a once beloved general sent shockwaves through Russia, and the secret police were swiftly mobilised to arrest Levitov.\n\nAs the dust settles, one thing has become clear; Levitov has weathered the storm. It seems his sentiments were wider spread then previously known, and combined with his legendary image, the ambitious general has managed to convert the Black and Reds to his cause. Now, the Vohzd will surely have to fear his own arrest. Meanwhile, the military itself has remained neutral, despite large sympathies towards Levitov, on account of the ongoing revolts."

After failing to achieve support among the Black and Reds and a shootout at army headquarters, General Levitov has been captured! While many sympathisers remain in the army, any challenge to Vohzd's authority is over, and the traitor will be punished in due time."
rus.17.a:0 "Long live the Vozhd"
rus.18.t:0 "Wrangel returned!"
rus.18.d:0 "As old allies Levitov and Skoblin tear each other apart in a foolish, chest thumping duel, a single man watches from the shadows, gathering strength. Long has he waited for a moment such as this. A moment when the young Kornilovites might be distracted, surely an inevitability considering the breadth of their ego.Since 1948, when the father of our nation; Lavr Kornilov passed away, he has been forced underground. As the old Vohzd's most loyal allies were replaced or exiled, Pyotor Wrangel grew quiet, seemingly tired by such a brazen display of opportunism and youthful folly.Now, he has returned. Around him gathers a party of the alienated; military officers who tire of the spectacle, old guard remnants and prominent whites. In Levitov's quest to depose a "weak" Vohzd, he has exposed his own weakness and  treasonous ambition.\n\nToday, the party marched on Moscow, and with the backing of the military following Levitov's failed stunt, forced Skoblin to resign. With the twin ingrates defeated, the old order has returned to Russia. Vohzd Wrangel will  restore the nation to its rightful path, draft policies to placate the people, and ensure revolts such as these never occur again. The great reckoning is at hand, may all traitors beware!"
