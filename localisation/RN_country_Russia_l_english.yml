rus.1.t:0 "Russia, We Greet You"
rus.1.d:0 "After the defeat of the perfidious Bolshevik hordes in 1920 it was hoped that the Russian people could finally rest easy. Yet fate had more in store, and history tends towards a twisted sense of humor. The Republican government that followed victory was a rotting house built upon a twisted structure. At its top was Kerensky, an ineffective figurehead who allowed ancestral lands to be sold away in the treaty of Brest Litovsk.Yet despite this state of affairs, all was not lost. Kerensky’s days became numbered following the 1924 Kolchak Putsch and the disastrous loss of Transamaur that followed. In secret, Russia's hero; Lavr Kornilov bided his time. He had defeated the Bolsheviks before, so again would he defeat the ineffectual puppets in the Duma.\n\nIn 1936, the inevitable day arrived. Before Kerensky’s body had even been recovered from the senate steps, swift plans were sprung into motion. In Saratov the Sons of the Motherland mobilised, eager at the chance to finally save the people from themselves. Had they refused to act, there would have been no telling who the democrats and their masonic handlers would have appointed.It was Kornilov who returned glory to the land, Kornilov who defeated the Hun, Kornilov who  united the race, and Kornilov who established the five headed regime. Russia was strong again, proud and free! The people rejoiced and praised the efforts of their Vozhd. Yet With his holy duty finished, the Vohzd traveled skywards, ready to dispense his foes on the astral plane.\n\nnToday a new face rules; Nikolai Skoblin, a man who by all accounts does not fill his predecessors shoes. Ruling with a mix of guile and nostalgia, his faction of Young Kornilovites is dually led by Mikhail Levitov, Skoblin’s deputy and right hand. Together they have sought to fulfill the vision of the great hero who came before, sticking closely, if unimaginatively, to his teachings. Dark forces brew beneath the surface. With each passing day, the “Loyal” minorities grow increasingly discontent and the Eurasianists, Illyinists, and the Black Hundreds plot to reshape the nation in their image. Without the guiding hand of its paternal father disorder has begun to rear its ugly head yet again. Should the National-State fail, the world will be left to the decadent socialists.  May god help Russia, for no-one else will..."

rus.12.t:0 "Ukraine Revolt"
rus.12.d:0 "Reports of traitorous towns on the periphery of Russian controlled Ukraine and sporadic shootings at farmsteads have been building steadily as of late,  despite our extensive state censorship efforts. However, it appears now the dam has officially broken, and the scale of the situation is truly staggering.\n\nIt appears a full scale revolt is currently underway across Eastern Ukraine, threatening the city of Kiev itself! Frenzied troop deployments and panicked Gopnik detachtments have been deployed to the Ukraine.\n\nA certain previously obscure group known as the/ "Ukranian Revolutionary Army/" led by the so-called \"Gentleman General\" Andriy Melnyk with its root in the old regime military seems to be the chief conspirators behind this treasonous affair."

rus.13.t:0 "Finland Revolt"
rus.13.d:0 "Startling news from Finland reported a mass armed insurrection is currently underway. While still somewhat distant from Helsinki, the strength of the revolt means it could quite easily reach the city soon. An organization known as the "Finnish Secret Army" composed of remaining generals of the old armed forces and connected to the old exile government in Norway is reportedly leading the charge.Lkely inspired by similar developments in Ukraine, and  feeding upon the resentment of the native people. As officials communiqué intercepted by the TaGoP sounded the alarm in Moscow.\n\n/"People of Finland, your armed forces never surrendered! We have bided our time, and now we ask your help. The homeland calls upon all patriots to rise in struggle one last time./""

rus.14.t:0 "Levitvo's Anger"
rus.14.d:0 "Levitov travelled with superhuman speed across the elongated halls of the Kremlin, propelled by fury. At his side stood several officers, each one struggling to maintain their disciplined stance while keeping pace with the general. Levitov slammed his shoulder against the hardwood, straining the tired hinges. The guards simply looked on in astonishment.\n\n"Nikolai Vladimirovich! You cowardly dog! Had a look out the window lately? Or shall I have to do that for you as well?"\n\nSkoblin's confusion turned to anger matching the general's. He stood up from his desk chair, assumed a confident posture, and retorted.\n\n"Calm yourself Mikhail! I have afforded you many privileges, but insubordination was not one of them! I am your Vohzd!"\n\nLevitov broke into boisterous laughter at the assertion, amused at the palpable irony that pervaded the air. He had just returned from Kiev, where the fruits of Skoblin's labour could be seen in the burning buildings and wounded soldiers. He took a deep breath, and stared at his old friend. Suddenly he realized the futility of this endeavor. In the office of the Vozhd, there could be no room for weakness or petty outburst. It was a cold determination that Kornilov had harnessed to save Russia once before, and so it would be again. One thing had become abundantly clear, the lazy rot that affected all bureaucrats had spread to his old friend." 
rus.14.a:0 "What might that man be up to"
rus.15.t:0 "A Speech before the Duma"
rus.15.d:0 ""Representatives of the Duma, Sons and Daughter of Russia, in light of my service to the motherland, I ask only that you grant me your ear in our hour of need. I will mince no words"\n\n"Russia is dying. Across the breadth of our motherland, subterfuge and sabotage undermine our great experiment. Our once loyal minorities, weak at heart, have yet again been poisoned by foreign ideologies and cowardly sentiments. These are the facts, laid bare for all to see by recent events."\n\n"Brave Patriot Knights; brothers in arms who struggle valiantly against the monstrous hordes that would doom the world to bolshevism, are currently deployed across our peripheries. I myself, as you know, have led them."\n\n"A great betrayal is afoot, within the highest levels of our government. In the office of great men, today sits a coward. A miserable wretch lurks the halls of the Kremlin, growing fat off the toil of our countrymen, sitting content as the apocalypse batters down our door."\n\n"Brothers, I ask you to assist me in my aims. We must remove this treasnonous excuse for a Vohzd at all costs. I seek not personal glory, but only the salvation of Russia, and Indeed all humanity. The hour of decision is at hand. Who will join me?"
rus.15.a:0 "Arrest him"

rus.16.t:0 "Arrest of Levitov"
rus.16.d:0 "In the fallout of massive revolts across the periphery of the Russian State, uprisings which seem to grow more dire with each passing day, a great drama is unfolding within the streets of Moscow.In the dog eat dog, darwinian game that is Russian politics, General Mikhail Levitov has initiated a bold operation. A longtime political ally of the current vozhd;  Nikolai Vladimirovich Skoblin, Levitov has begun openly calling for the leader's resignation. Besides general derision, Levitov has  cited inadequate response to the uprisings and general cowardice in fulfillment of his duty. Of course such a treasonous declaration from a once beloved general sent shockwaves through Russia, and the secret police were swiftly mobilised to arrest Levitov.\n\nAs the dust settles, one thing has become clear; Levitov has weathered the storm. It seems his sentiments were wider spread then previously known, and combined with his legendary image, the ambitious general has managed to convert the Black and Reds to his cause. Now, the Vohzd will surely have to fear his own arrest. Meanwhile, the military itself has remained neutral, despite large sympathies towards Levitov, on account of the ongoing revolts."

After failing to achieve support among the Black and Reds and a shootout at army headquarters, General Levitov has been captured! While many sympathisers remain in the army, any challenge to Vohzd's authority is over, and the traitor will be punished in due time."
rus.17.a:0 "Long live the Vozhd"
rus.18.t:0 "Wrangel returned!"
rus.18.d:0 "As old allies Levitov and Skoblin tear each other apart in a foolish, chest thumping duel, a single man watches from the shadows, gathering strength. Long has he waited for a moment such as this. A moment when the young Kornilovites might be distracted, surely an inevitability considering the breadth of their ego.Since 1948, when the father of our nation; Lavr Kornilov passed away, he has been forced underground. As the old Vohzd's most loyal allies were replaced or exiled, Pyotor Wrangel grew quiet, seemingly tired by such a brazen display of opportunism and youthful folly.Now, he has returned. Around him gathers a party of the alienated; military officers who tire of the spectacle, old guard remnants and prominent whites. In Levitov's quest to depose a "weak" Vohzd, he has exposed his own weakness and  treasonous ambition.\n\nToday, the party marched on Moscow, and with the backing of the military following Levitov's failed stunt, forced Skoblin to resign. With the twin ingrates defeated, the old order has returned to Russia. Vohzd Wrangel will  restore the nation to its rightful path, draft policies to placate the people, and ensure revolts such as these never occur again. The great reckoning is at hand, may all traitors beware!"

Thou art my comfort and my goal, my dream and my wish. Thou alone art my master... thou alone."\n\nThe Marshal's mind wandered to the Great War, fighting against the Germans, leading the legions of Holy Russia, pushing westwards and stamping his feet triumphantly in Berlin. He remembered the days where he - Petr Nikolaevich - and Kornilov - that magnificent bastard - stood side by side, parading the gallant youths that had sacrificed so much for a hard-earned victory. But now, Russia has grown corrupt. As Kornilov departed to another, more peaceful realm, the nation nudged further and further towards a more selfish and egoistical form. The Young Kornilovites! How dare they call themselves that! Russia weakens, and rifts in society can be seen left and right. How long would it take for the Vozhd to see?!

rus.78.d:0 "Skoblin cried out for the guards to secure his way out of the Kremlin, yet to no avail. Meanwhile, Levitov just sat in his chair, accepting his fate without even a semblance of struggle. Minutes ago they were shouting at each other, funnily enough. They heard a loud bang as the door was thrown open by black-clad soldiers, holding rifles in their hand. After them came another man, this time tall and wearing a black cossack outfit - a sight that everyone would recognize as the very elderly and very annoyed Black Baron. Somewhat notably enough, he was flanked by a bespectacled man, Mikhail Drozdovsky.\n\n'Nikolai Vladimirovich, Mikhail Nikolaevich, I've heard that there's some sort of a dispute between you two." Said Wrangel with a tiny sliver of an attempt of cruel sarcasm. "I think it's up to us to arbitrate between you two young'uns." Said Wrangel as he walked into the middle of the room with his forces. Skoblin immediately leaned to the wall as a sudden feeling of weakness struck him.\n\n"If you two want power so much...so be it. Perhaps neither of you deserve it." Wrangel threw a small object into the table, prompting a flinch from Levitov and a shudder from Skoblin - half the room away. It was a pen. "We've.. agreed," Wrangel nodded towards Drozdovsky before continuing, "That the Army has a basis for removing you two from your seats, and that it's the best course of action to save Holy Russia. Now, go on - sign here and here." Skoblin and Levitov both begrudgingly signed the documents - it was two separate letters of resignation. Then, after a short vote, Wrangel was elected as Vozhd and Drozdovsky as his deputy Vozhd. Behind closed doors, Russia's two strongest figures were removed from politics with little to no violence, or perharps not yet."

As the radios squawked and the telephone operators found themselves helpless, all seemed lost. \n\n It was in Saratov where we made our stand.  With backs to the trains and eyes to the River, our tired eyed men gathered for a last stand against the servants of those inbred cowards. With bullet and bomb, our future was decided; evolution or regression?\n\nAs the air grows quiet, and the sobbing stops, a sigh of relief is held. Then, joy grows in increasing tempo.

What that protagonist had started seemed to find no end. One crime became two, two became three, and three became an escalating series of desperate cover ups and almost admissions.\n\n“Ah fuck” he thought as he returned from daydream “When one finds himself in a river, of what use is resisting the current?”\n\nWhile some parts of that tale appealed to the General however, he had committed no crime. Instead, his heart fluttered with excitement. Atop a horse before columns of soldiers, he had entered the outskirts of the city. Cheering crowds awaited them, a gathering of the dispossessed turned hopeful.\n\nThe great Russian game, sparked in 1919 by that damned Vladimir Ilyich was coming to a swift end. With their victory in Saratov, no forces remained to delay the inevitable. As the crowds sang and impulsive soldiers bought flowers to place within their barrels the General grinned. Sanity and compassion, thought lost to the historical tide, had triumphed!\n\nSome time later, the men reached the City center. Thick doors were thrust open with a cheer and each room secured. To the horror of the Kornilovist envo, “Hail Russia” or “Hail the Vozhd” were not heard. Instead, Krakovetsky’s voice took an unexpected turn.\n\n“Demagogues be damned!” boomed the General to his comrades “Today is a victory for the people!”"

A quiet tension reigned in all present, something they shared with the city below.\n\nThe first of the five held his gun towards the corner, where the hostages sat dejected. The second fiddled anxiously, an intense fellow who was failing to wrangle sound from the complex radio equipment. The third placed the record upon the player, and stood impatiently with needle in hand.\n\nFinally, after a bit more fiddling the second man relaxed. His stern face became a smile, and he nodded to the needle-keeper. It was another moment before the scratchiness faded, and then, in an event that defied the cold winds and the frightful hostages came sound. Slow at first, then louder.\n\nAcross the city of Moscow that night the people stirred in their slumber. Windows cautiously opened, the destitute froze in place, and the soldiers looked up. The soft words were beautiful, no matter what future they signified.\n\nIn both the radio tower and the city below, scattered voices sang that well known tune. "

rus.90.d:0 "Wrangel sighed, rubbed his temples, and quietly chuckled. Looking at the big picture, it really was quite funny in that absurd sort of way. He let the telephone drop to the desk, dial tone and all. He had thought the madness was over, that God’s toying had ceased. It had been his duty to seize Russia from those spoiled children, pretenders who let the nation fall to anarchy in the interest of saving their own skin. The leader of Russia rarely held the same face for long, and he intended to stabilise it.\n\n Now as the footsteps in the hallway grew louder and louder, he realised it had all been for nothing. Drozdovsky was himself but a foolish child despite his advanced age. Pytor was the only adult left in Russia. Though he knew it sinful, in such a moment, he thought only of retiring to his dacha. “You Win” he said cynically with an added “screeching brats” under his breath.\n\n The doors opened on cue, and with them came the pointed barrels. He addressed Drozdovodgosky only, the apathy obvious in his voice.\n\n “Tell me Mikhail Gordeevich, was it the land reform or the proposed constitution?”\n\n Pyotr left before truly receiving an answer, confident his days were numbered. It seemed Drozdovsky was more nostalgic than he had previously thought.. All the carnage since 1914 would now be entirely pointless; a cosmic joke. Absolute Czarism had returned from  hiatus, and Wrangel could not bear it, god forgive him."
