BRA_aib_remnants:0 "Integralist Remnants"
BRA_aib_remnants_desc: "Despite their attempt to subvert the will of the people by reinstating the monarchy and their deposistion by the Brazilian Army in 1938, the “Ação Integralista Brasileira” (the Brazilian Integralist Action) party remains active in the dark.These vile reactionary terrorists are a plague on the countryside. They must be expunged!"
BRA_democracy_bastion:0 "Bastion of Democracy"
BRA_democracy_bastion_desc: "After the brief horrors of the Intergalist Trianium the Brazilian nation has resoundly cried in unison: NEVER AGAIN!\n\nWith the horrible news coming from the neighboring reactionary regimes, the Brazilian populace, armed forces, and political establishment stand vigilant against any tyrannical ideology that dare show its face. We will defend our 1939 constitution at all costs!"
BRA_neutral_nation:0 "Neutralidade Interesseira"
BRA_neutral_nation_desc: "Brazil is officially a Neutral Nation, taking no side in the petty squabbles between the ideological blocks. This has resulted in Brazil being not only one of the very few countries that universally good diplomatic relations, but in being one of the very few that openly trades with all nations on earth. This stance has boosted the Brazilian economy to new heights. The “country of the future” has come to pass today."
BRA_vigilant_population:0 "Vigilant Population"
BRA_vigilant_population_desc: "We narrowly avoided the vile poison that has gripped the continent, yet our brother nations were not so lucky. The fact that Brazil sits surrounded by reactionary regimes, mirrors of our own short integralist period, has instilled a generalized fear in the population. Our country must be prepared for the inevitable showdown to come.As the president has said;\n\nFor if any who dare to raise their hand against us, we will be ready!"

POLITICS_Osvaldo_Aranha_DESC: "Osvaldo Aranha was born to a life of ease in 1884, the son of an old Riograndense family. In seeking a challenge he would come to study law as a young man. Soon study would grow into practice, and practice would grow into a career in government. Osvaldo had become a congressman and a prominent one at that. He was most popular for his unabashed criticism of the growing integralist movement, a status that would enable him to become legendary.\n\nWhen the Integralist Trianium usurped the republic in 1937, Aranha discovered his deep seated bravery. Not only did he continue his criticism, but he refused to flee with his colleagues. Even in the face of annihilation Aranha was stubborn and steadfast.\n\nAfter the Republican counter-coup a year later Aranha would find himself invited into the provisional government. He would serve in several key minister positions before finding himself catapulted to leadership. It was a title he had earned handily owing to the perception that he would best be able to keep the Democratic Consensus afloat in the stormy years of the Second World War.\n\nAranha’s Presidency is widely regarded as a new birth for the Republic. His domestic reforms have enfranchised and supported large parts of the population, particularly women, workers, and the illiterate. Internationally he has maintained a position of splendid neutrality, regarding good relations with all powers as vital. Under Aranha Brazil has become renowned worldwide. To many it stands as the lifeboat of Democracy."
