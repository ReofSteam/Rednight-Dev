### Starting Ideas ### 

ENG_united_britain:0 "United Britain"
ENG_united_britain_desc:0 "Its name is ancient but its history was the sorrows of the two nations eternal at war. One nation of the forgotten  gentle children of England's pasture greens, condemned to a thousand years night of humiliation and misery by the nation of the idles and the divisive tribalism that pitched brothers against brother, as Scots against Anglos. No more, the chains are broken, Britain is a nation once more"
ENG_postwar_recession:0 "Postwar Recession"
ENG_postwar_recession_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Industrial Program of Comrade Mosley have prepared our nation for the recent titanic struggle and brought the laurel of the victor upon our brows. But peace have returned, and the economy have been struggling to return to normality."
ENG_french_rivalry:0 "French Rivalry - Low Hostility"
ENG_french_rivalry_desc:0 "Socialism is not an altar of which we are to die on, but the moving heart of the people. The arrogance of Paris would tell us otherwise and it's their right to do so, but in fair Britannia, we have a certain way of doing things. While the French dominated Internationale tolerates Britains path to Socialism thus far,\n§RThis policy might change in the future, brining about troublesome times§"
ENG_food_import:0 "Food Import Dependency"
ENG_food_import_desc:0 "Our glorious revolution have put an end to the ruthless colonial regime over 2 decades ago, but with the loss of the colonies, although unavoidable and righteous, came damage to the homeland, especially in the field of agriculture. The homeland have lost agricultural self sustainability many years ago, and with the loss of cheap imports from the colonies, it became reliant on food imports from France and other allies, which puts a strain on our economy."

ENG.2.t:0 "Cambridge University Riot"
ENG.2.d:0 "What began as a simple act of vandalism in a Cambridge pub has grown into a national incident within the Union of Britain, one that is rapidly spiraling out of control! This morning, following the arrest of two students belonging to the local "Youth for Workplace Democracy" organization for their involvement in defacing property, massive protests gripped Cambridge university.\n\n Demanding the immediate release of both students,  greater freedom of expression and more democracy in both education and the workplace, the student body has almost overwhelmingly turned out in support of their ideas.\n\nRiot police, supplemented by Revolutionary Guard units arrived around 10am in an attempt to disperse the crowds. However, these efforts have only made the situation more dire, as protests turn to riots, local roads are blocked off, and stories of bloody noses and jeering shouts spill into the city itself. Authorities are preparing an escalated responses and the nation watches with weary eyes. Might this be a moment to remember? "
ENG.2.a:0 "Youngsters these days!"
ENG.3.t:0 "The Engilish Socialists support the protestors"
ENG.3.d:0 "Political disaster has overtaken the British Government! Following the failed negotiation, major representatives of the English-Socialist faction have declared a universal withdrawal from the Trade Union Congress.\n\nChief among grievances voiced by faction representatives was the continuing violent crackdown upon protesting students and workers in cities across northern England. Now, both common card carriers as well as representatives themselves can be seen manning the very same barricades in cities like Cambridge.\n\n Faith in the government and the Chairman have been irreparably damaged, and the TUC has been left scrambling to fill the void left by the loss of a pillar of British politics. Many wonder if the situation might escalate further, should the government take action against those unions that have withdrawn."
ENG.3.a:0 "Arrest all their leaders"
ENG.3.b:0 "We can't risk it"
ENG.4.t:0 "Workers Revolutionary Council of Britain"
ENG.4.d:0 "The situation in the Union of Britain has descended into barbarism of continued strikes, crackdowns, riots, followed the failed round of negotiation! In light of the government's failure to resolve the situation, students and union representatives have stopped short of an outright violent revolution and declared a new government in Birmingham;The Workers Revolutionary Council.\n\n While only officially intended to coordinate actions between protestors, few hold illusions that this body is anything but a dual power government to contest London's authority. Violent struggle with Revolutionary Guard and Police units has already erupted, and the city of Birmingham has effectively seceded from the Union. Accusations of Russian sabotage, tyranny by the Chairman, and partisan reprisals fly wild. The British Isles await with bated breath, surrounded in fortresses of overturned cars and streetside bariccades"
ENG.4.a:0 "We must resume the negotiation before this get worse"
ENG.4.b:0 "Crush them now!"
ENG.5.t:0 "The Great National Strike"
ENG.5.d:0 "Today, the British people create history. For months now the world has watched the "British Situation" build and build. Today, it has reached a crescendo. Climactic street battles and failed negotiations have culminated in a massive "All Britain General Strike" in which the entire economy has ground to a screeching halt. Workers, Bureaucrats and Students alike chant together from London to Glasgow, and the red flag flies from all corners. In addition, Foreign and a few domestic presses are printing in support of the movement.\n\n Many are drawing nervous comparisons to the 1925 revolution itself, and it seems that the Mosley government is effectively dead. A new era is sure to begin soon…"
ENG.5.a:0 "England, you are too cruel"
ENG.5.b:0 "Arise ye workers!"
ENG.5.c:0 "That's enough!"
ENG.7.t:0 "The English Revolution"
ENG.7.d:0 "The chaos so long strangling the Union of Britain has come to an end. Across the country, millions shed tears, and millions more rejoice.  Oswald Mosley; the grand protector of the Union of Britain, saviour of the revolution, terror in the night, and the black sheep of the socialist bloc, is no more. Faced with a paralyzed economy and a population on the brink of civil war, the Chairman finally yielded. Mosley has resigned from his post, taking his entire cabinet with him.\n\nWith the conclusion of what is now being dubbed internationally as the "Second Glorious Revolution"a struggle for power immediately erupted between more radical leftists based in Birmingham, and the English Socialist militias.\n\nAlliances were made and broken, frenzied sporadic shootouts ended in bloodshed, and rapid arrests were carried out. As the dust settles,  the victor has become clear; The English Socialists have assumed control of the Union of Britain.\n\nDespite the efforts of vain radicals to coerce the English people into erasure of their own identity, the English Socialists have triumphed. The soul of England remains safe, and the unique character of the British revolution has been preserved. Promising sanity, stability, and an end to the Mosleyite Kleptocracy,  Minister Blair would surely be heartened by this outcome, where he was around to see it himself."
ENG.7.a:0 "The long, long night is over"
ENG.6.t:0 "The WRC Seized Government"
ENG.6.d:0 "The chaos so long strangling the Union of Britain has come to an end. Across the country, millions shed tears, and millions more rejoice. Oswald Mosley; the grand protector of the Union of Britain, saviour of the revolution, terror in the night,  and the black sheep of the socialist bloc, is no more. Faced with a paralyzed economy and a population on the brink of civil war, the chairman finally yielded. Mosley has resigned from his post, taking his entire cabinet with him.\n\nWith the conclusion of  what is now being dubbed internationally as the "Second Revolution", representatives of the English Socialist faction made swift moves to secure power and stability. However, this action quickly proved ineffective, as it became apparent that the rabble was unwilling to accept any remnant of the old order.\n\nThus, the rival government formed in Birmingham known as the "Workers Revolutionary Council" has stepped in to fill the vacuum with its militia. Promising to "complete what was started in 1925" It seems a true proletarian revolution is here to stay, casting down all remnants of the bourgeois society. Finally, the English worker will control his own destiny! The future is bright…"
ENG.6.a:0 "Workers of the World, Unite!"
Uob.1.t:0 "New Britian Plan"
Uob.1.d:0 "Captain Nicholas Mosley, Republican Army will now speak!"\n\n"Dear comrades, fellow servicemen and all citizens, today is a historic day for our country, for its celebration of our recent civic feast of the industrial congress election have just passed and we are ready to steer our ship of state to a new direction and that direction have been made clear by the will of the nation in the ballots across factories of Britain.The people of Britain are behind their dream, the dream that was formed by my father in the fateful days of 1937, a Britain glorious and free, freed from the shackles of poverty and fear, my father has promised you: win the war and the world will be ours. But the people was not ready then, the war was still taking its toll on our people and we missed our chance to turn its fiery fire into a new revolution, the Comrade Chairman heard the voices of the people and we have waited but now, now is the hour and now is the time.We, the soldiers, the hero-workers can not wait any longer before the fire of our unique opportunity for national mobilisation to pass away, thus i call upon the ministers of the state, the civil servants, glorious workers and farmers, our brother-in-arms still fulfilling the honourable internationalist duty across Europe, i call this upon you: Unite! Unite! Let’s us go forward as crusading regiments, armed with the fervent spirit for righteousness to reign forever on earth!"
Uob.1.a:0 "Glory to New Britain, Glory to its Heroes"
Uob.2.t:0 "A Nation of Coal and Steel" 
Uob.2.d:0 "Despite the Industrialization of Britain, our national consciousness is still imbued with the Shires and fields of this nation; from the hilly North to the flat and reedy lands of Cornwall. During the time of Chairman Mosley, Britain saw many state-sponsored poet whimsical talk of the great green land as it was increasingly rolled back for the rising industrial base. Rural folk have been dismissed as yokels, relics of a bygone era, while the great historical landmarks of the country have become dusty and forgotten.\n\nNo longer! Chairman Mosley and his administration have collectively decided that the rural areas of the nation shall be given much more attention. *Real* attention, not just some poets waxing lyrically or some token packages. Farmers shall be given new subsidies, Dying communities shall be given economic tonics they have so desperately needed for so long, while some rural repatriation shall be encouraged.\n\nThe general non-rural population shall also be included in this endeavor. Agricultural drafts have been proposed for years, and they have been advocated as a good old fashioned way to teach the youth hard work and make the “urban folk” feel the soil of their ancestors."
Uob.2.a:0 "We have much to be proud of"
Uob.3.t:0 "English Way of Life" 
Uob.3.d:0 "The Union and the illegatamate state before it has always dirived its power from unity, the union was formed on unity and work, this is the english way of life. "

Farmers shall be given new subsidies, Dying communities shall be given economic tonics they have so desperately needed for so long, while some rural repatriation shall be encouraged.\n\nThe general non-rural population shall also be included in this endeavor. Agricultural drafts have been proposed for years, and they have been advocated as a good old fashioned way to teach the youth hard work and make the “urban folk” feel the soil of their ancestors."
Uob.4.a:0 "Seems pretty good!"
Uob.5.t:0 "Towards Food Self Sufficiency" 
Uob.5.d:0 "In order for the union to stand strong we must sometimes rely on others but for such a vital resource such as wheat and grain we sohuld be able to hold our own, we will move the union towards food self sufficiency"
Uob.5.a:0 "The union stands strongs"
Uob.6.t:0 "British Railway Collective" 
Uob.6.d:0 "Ever since we invented trains we were able to keep our countrys supoply chains up tight and working however without railways our trains won't be able to go anywere, we must rebuild our railways and complete our trainline, we will rebuild our tracks and our nation!"
Uob.6.a:0 "Tracks must be built"
Uob.7.t:0 "A National Bourgeoisie" 
Uob.7.d:0 "The economy of the Union of Britain has long been built upon the economic principles of Syndicalism; a Socialist branch built upon Labour Unions and Co-operative businesses. Long the dominant strand of social and economic development, Chairman Mosley has over the course of is administration begun moving against this model, centralizing economic organs towards his new and reformed ministries This move has been proven to be the correct one time and time again; from the needs of mass mobilization in the Second World War to the postwar reconstruction initiatives to the needs of all of Europe.\n\nNowadays, the European economy has grown even more ravenous and “needy” as the European economies mostly recover from the hardship inflicted by the War years.With Britain becoming the Industrial heartland of the Socialist order in Europe, the responsibility of the Socialist economies requires we get creative and perhaps break down some orthodoxies.\n\nThus, Chairman Mosley and his allies have hashed out a basic plan to renovate the economy to meet new demands and aid our own economic development. Known officially as the “Economic development initiative of 1952”, the plan involves re-introducing some Market aspects to our economies, along with creating a controlled “National Bourgeoisie” class to oversee these changes. As such, this plan has been colloquially termed the “National Bourgeoisie plan”.Of course, none of these reforms will change the fundamental aspects of the Socialist state, and this new class shall always be accountable to the Working men and women of Britain."
Uob.7.a:0 "Blimey, seems ambitious!"
Uob.8.t:0 "Middle Class Socialism" 
Uob.8.d:0 "Over the years we have had at peace the middle class has began to grow, with this our industry and population will grow, the Union is a haven for the middle class"
Uob.8.a:0 "Okay"
Uob.9.t:0 "Steady As She Goes" 
Uob.9.d:0 "Comrade Grand Protector Mosley’s New Britain plan has officially entered its sixteenth year; and what glorious years they have been! So much has improved since the early revolutionary era. Our industry has grown to great heights, not even dreamed of under capitalism and shocking even the greatest advocates of industrialization in the Socialist world. Our Agriculture has begun to order itself, with co-operatives and private landholdings growing ever more productive every year.\n\nEven culturally, our nation has improved. The average Briton can quote Shakespeare and other famous playwrights by heart, as government funded acting troupes criss-cross the nation. Restaurants serve elaborate meals with simple ingredients, sourced directly from our isle. "
Uob.9.a:0 "Okay"
ENG.9.t:0 "The Death of Eric Blair"
ENG.9.d:0 "The night had been long and fraught, full of coughing fits and arguments over correct preparation of tea. It had been a cacophony of regret, shouting, reflection, when all was said and done, Love.\n\nEric came in and out of consciousness throughout, a wry smile covering his face. A passive observer, he simply watched the crowd of  friends and family that danced around the room before him.  After all his years as minister,  in the thick of impassioned debates, He wouldn't have had it any other way. It wasn't until around 4am, when the rabble finally fell quiet that  all eyes turned to Blair. He cleared his throat, and a small croak escaped his lips.\n\n"Anglican, please let it be Anglican.."\n\nAs the morning birds began to chirp on the green hills, Eric Blair finally fell into a deep sleep. Quiet sobs gripped the room, only broken by a few stoic friends from the service. Though he was not born upon the isles, Blair felt boundless love for England. In the end, it had returned the favour. He breathed his last, and his body went limp. So was the end of an era."
ENG.9.a:0 "England will miss a faithful son."
ENG.10.a:0 "England awaits her victors"
ENG.11.t:0 "Elections Begin!"
ENG.11.d:0 "Once again, the people of Britain turn out for the hallowed tradition of Democratic election. Candidates from numerous factions jockey for the favor of the people, promising everything from better roads to less farm regulation. Three primary factions have emerged, the National Labourites, the Maximalists and the English Socialists, all with their own unique ideas as to how to improve the Union and aid the position of the average Briton."
ENG.11.a:0 "National Labourites"
ENG.11.b:0 "Maximalists"
ENG.11.c:0 "English Socialists"
ENG.12.t:0 "National Labourites Win Election"
ENG.12.d:0 "A shocking result has emerged from the British elections. The National Labouritte faction has emerged victorious by the narrowest of margins. Espousing a moderate line, they seek to keep Mosley’s policies “sane” and “measured”, while not descending into fanaticism. Strangely enough, they also seek some rollbacks of the Mosleyite economic policies, a position which has certainly not immediately endeared them to many in the British public.\n\nGrand Protector Mosley has issued statements praising the smooth election and the newly elected representatives, proclaiming that ‘Their honesty and conscientiousness in the face of opposition is exactly what Britain needs now”. Meanwhile Malcolm MacDonald, the leader of the Labourites has congratulated the “good fight” of their opposition."
ENG.12.a:0 "This wasn’t supposed to happe- I mean, Congratulations!"
ENG.13.t:0 "Maximalists Win Elections!"
ENG.13.d:0 "In a result that surprises absolutely no one, the faction aligned with Grand Protector Oswald Molsey has emerged triumphant in the recent elections in the Union of Britain. Thorough believers in the doctrines of Maximalism and Totalism, the Maximalists have vowed to continue Mosley’s policies and ideals, whatever the cost.\n\nGrand Protector Mosley has issued statements praising the smooth election and the newly elected representatives, proclaiming that ‘Their dedication and stalwartness in the face of opposition is exactly what Britain needs now”. Meanwhile, the Maximalists themselves have congratulated the “good fight” of their opposition."
ENG.13.a:0 "Congratulations!"
ENG.14.t:0 "English Socialists Win The Elections!"
ENG.14.d:0 "A somewhat surprising result has emerged from the elections. The so-called “English Socialists” have emerged victorious by somewhat comfortable margins. Romanticists opposed to French Marxian influence, they believe in the ideal of a Socialist England with a uniquely English Socialism. Not opposed to Mosley in any way,  they are also not slavish Maximalists and may oppose Mosley on some key issues./n/nGrand Protector Mosley has issued statements praising the smooth election and the newly elected representatives, proclaiming that ‘Their idealism and Patriotism in the face of opposition is exactly what Britain needs now”. Meanwhile Hugh Dalton, the leader of the English Socialists has congratulated the “good fight” of their opposition."
