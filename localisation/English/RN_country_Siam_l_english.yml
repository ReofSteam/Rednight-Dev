POLITICS_PRIDI_BANOMYONG_DESC:0 "§YRegent of Thailand§!\nFor most of his life, Pridi Banomyong has harbored powerful reformist sentiments. He believes in a modern and proud Thailand, one that cares for its people and stands on its own two feet. Perhaps his views developed during his time as a prominent civil servant, or simply amongst revolutionary chaos of the 1930s. Regardless, he was never in the right place to act on these ideals. Content to let his lifelong friend Plaek Phibunsongkhram usher in an end to 150 years of absolute monarchy.It was not until the disastrous war against India in 1943 that he would get his chance. Weary of the reactionary and irredentist bent his comrade had used to drag Thailand into disaster, he soon found the destiny of the nation had fallen into his lap. A swift coup to end the war./n/nEnemies old and new lurk, eager to show the upstart minister with a simple law degree his place. Pridi has much to contend with, but he is determined to succeed. He will defend Thailand and build it anew, even if its own worst enemy is itself."
