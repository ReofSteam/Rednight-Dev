#Description
nationalist_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§GNationalist Socialism§!\nNationalism is not the force of the reaction nor the social_conservative. Nationalism is the ever changing power of a people, it is a devotion to something that is always changing and yet is felt to be mystically the same. It is the bridge between the future and the past. What could therefore be more patriotic, more nationalist than the glorious cause of equality and the elevation of the working people to their dignity?"
revolutionary_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§GRevolutionary Socialism§!\nRevolutionary Socialism is an ideology that suggests that the material circumstances of capitalism will inevitably result in workers’ revolts and revolutions of emancipation. Revolutionary Socialists often criticise social democracy as reinforcing and protecting capitalism from the inevitable, also criticising other socialist ideologies for utopianism or reformism. Revolutionary Socialists of the council-communist and other varieties also criticise Leninism and related forms of Revolutionary Socialism, searching for alternate routes of achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat."
syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§GSyndicalism§!\nSyndicalisms reject the state as an agent for the common good for the workers of the world. Syndicalisms seek to collectively own the means of production on the community level, with no space for state-run or directed industry. They also advocate for the near-complete devolution of political power, in many cases using the trade union as the basic political unit."
moderate_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "§GModerate Socialsim§!\nWhile moderate socialists believe in the inherent immortality and instability of the capitalist system, they tend to be more lax in their policy. In states such as these, anything from cooperatives to limited private industry might still exist, with a broader transition likely relegated to a gradual implementation. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to categorize them as reformists, for these movements are nevertheless committed to the revolutionary cause of a better world."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "§GSocial Democracy§!\nThough precursor forms of this tendency have existed since the dawn of the Socialist movement, Social Democracy as it is now understood was primarily a product of a Weltkrieg era split in international tendency.Social democrats advocate the retention of the capitalist mode of production in most industries, alongside strong social welfare programs and in some cases limited nationalisation. Despite being mostly discredited in favour of revolutionary socialism, a social democratic presence can still be felt in various states around the globe."
social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "§GSocial Liberalism§!\nLiberalism proposes two main kinds of freedom. The first is economic freedom, that people be free to pursue their own economic ventures whether they be operating as individuals or companies. The second is social freedom, that people are free to express themselves in whatever way they please without fear of retaliation from either state or fellow citizen. As such, the liberal state fulfils the task of protecting its citizens from abuse and with maintaining their liberties as well. Typical policies include laissez-faire economics, secular policies and welfare to a somewhat limited extent. Liberals usually occupy a middle ground in democracies and often work with their immediate right and left. "
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "§GConservatism§!\nConservatism represents a movement opposed to rapid social change and sudden upheaval. Conservatives instead pursue the preservation of traditional values, whether they be religious or otherwise more secular in nature. They are therefore natural allies of institutions such as monarchies and the church. Virtues like patriotism and loyalty are held in high regard and as such police and soldiers are presented as excellent role-models.\nConservatives attempt to make reforms in order to best protect these social customs and are most often found working alongside liberals in democracies."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "§GAuthoritarian Democracy§!\nThe term authoritarian democracy is a very loose one, applicable to a number of different political factions with very few constants between other than the fact that they view democracy as nothing more than a formality to cement their authoritarian rule, their policies otherwise range from being open to liberal, social-democrat-like, social reforms, to being nothing more than authoritarian social_conservatives. Authoritarian Democracy also ranges through different systems of government from, seemingly, democratic republics to semi-constitutional monarchies and is generally seen as an alternative to the absolutism of old in the latter."
autocratic_subtype_desc:0 "§GAutocracy§!\nAn autocracy is simply put, a nation where one man has absolute (although not always unquestioned) power. The title or position of said autocrat varies deeply. Some are monarchs, holding onto ancient power invested in their forebears centuries ago. Others are military strongmen, having wrested power through force. Then there are those that have come to power through intrigue or even the popular mandate. Regardless of their title or rank, they all share in their totalitarian level of power in their respective territory. For this reason, autocrats are able to pursue whatever plans or policy they wish, without need for much discussion. Beyond their specific level of control, autocrats can have a variety of economic, social, religious and foreign policies."
national_corporatist_subtype_desc:0 "§GNational Corporatism§!\nNational Corporatism claims to be a third way, rising above the common left-right dichotomy. For under this system, such questions are irrelevant, replaced with a simple creed; from the wealthiest capitalist to the lowest peasant, all must serve the state. However, for those of wealth and privilege the world over, it is both an existential threat, and a great ally. National Corporatists may not support capitalist aims exactly, but they do promise to preserve traditions and curb the red tide, and for many that is good enough. To some, they are the last hope for Europe, and indeed, the world."
ultraconservative_subtype_desc:0 "§GUltraconservative§!\nUltraconservatism describes a trend in social_conservative thought that involves returning to an idealized past, and violently rejecting societal change. Ultra Conservatives perceive traditions and norms of an old political era as desirable, and wish to return to them in a form of national revitalization. They are staunch enemies of liberal and sociaalist values, and will seek to maintain hierarchies."
