### Events ###
fra.1.t:0 "Action of May"
fra.1.d:0 "Anton was two blocks out when he began to hear the screams.\n\nShouts of \"Vive la révolution!\" and \"L'Internationale Sera le genre humain!\" cried out, vibrating  through the air like a shimmering energy. Though he was often stoic, such an attitude would be impossible today. Anton's  heart swelled, and a grin bridged his ears. It was an expression of unrepentant joy and love for his country.As Anton approached the Parisian crowd that had gathered to watch the parading tanks, he spotted Mallory's wild hair and ragged overalls from behind. She stood next to Darcy, a tall AlFRAian friend and rival suitor. A flash of jealousy crossed Anton's face, before it was swiftly suppressed. Soon he found himself behind the pair, and an arm slung over each shoulder.\n\n"Comrades! What a day for a parade eh?" he spoke in his most charmingly silly accent. Mallory laughed, and Darcy enveloped his comrade in a seemingly genuine hug. The trio spent the day observing the theatrics, laughing as jets flew overhead and officers waved to the crowd. Finally, as noon approached, Mallory pointed to something with concern.\n\n"What the fuck's their problem?" she exclaimed, highlighting a string of Tanks that had begun to peel off the main road towards the crowd. Anton looked on with disbelief as the tanks pushed through the masses like a paddle through water. It took a moment for the realization to dawn, and Darcy shouted what they all were thinking \"The BGT's that way!\"Despite a few bottles and rocks thrown, the crowd remained mostly bewildered.\n\nAnton and his friends made their way to his Uncle's residence, where they might secure a radio. However they only heard noise. Soon, soldiers count being seen linFRAing about the streets. Anton's concern turned to anFRA. Whatever was going on, it had to be stopped."
fra.1.a:0 "Paris...Paris...Do you read"
fra.2.t:0 "Committee of French Revolutionaries"
fra.2.d:0 "Pierre sat before a set of television cameras and microphones, clutching a written statement and preparing to record. Like a festering wound, the sentiments that had led him to this moment had been steadily building for a decade. In those days governing the occupation zone, the words had held a life of their own, tumbling out of him onto trusted comrades. Now, it seemed wrong to cage them behind a prepared statement. Was he to be simply another politician? No. He pushed the papers aside, and hand signaled the men behind the cameras.\"Comrades, I am General Pierre Brossolette, and all my life I have had a certain idea of France\"\n\nAs Pierre spoke, his tempo continued to rise. He explained the corruption of the republic, the career bureaucrats that believed themselves above the common people, and the backroom dealings that would squander a once proud history. He spoke at length of his time in FRAmany, his witnessing of mistreatment towards soldiers and the growing power of the Bureau. The Bureau who would seek only to perpetuate themselves, and commit hypocritical atrocities across the world.He explained, in fiery eloquence, his vision for a new France, and their demands. Finally, when all was said and done, he took a deep breath, and began listing names. Pierre shifted in his seat, and stared deeply into the camera's center.\n\n"We accept responsibility for our actions, and remain dedicated only to France and her people. Thank you.\""

fra.3.d:0 "\"The unthinkable has occurred. A cabal of thugs have seized the people's government in an illegal attempt to force their counter-revolutionary philosophies upon us. A day of celebration has become a struggle for the revolution itself! The old oppressor still lurks across the dniper, waiting for a sign of weakness, surely content with Brosolette and his conspirators.We must use the oldest weapon in our arsenal. Strike! Shut down this pretender government until it can be returned to the hands of the people. Save the republic!\"\n\nThese words, and others like them are being spread rapidly across the French countryside. Agitated by various publications and now displaced government officials, it seems a massive general strike may be brewing. The demands of the Brossolette putsch may remain unfulfilled, as it seems likely its days are numbered should the people reject its mandate."
fra.3.a:0 "Paris en colère"
franews.2.t:0 "Action of May"
franews.2.d:0 "In the annals of history, there are some events so unforeseeable that they appear divine. So it is that Paris, birthplace of the revolution and heart of the Socialist bloc, has been brought to its knees during today's may day celebrations!\n\nWhile information coming out of the city has been contradicting and scarce, what we do know paints a startling picture. Pierre Brosolette, recently returned governor-general of the FRAman occupation zone, is reportedly responsible. The full list of his compatriots remains unknown, but other reports have claimed involvement of Henri Frenay in cutting communications outside the city, and De la Vierge in besieging naval command.Garrisons across the city have been captured or held at bay, and those few government officials that were outside have begun organising to retake it. \n\nThe Russian State embassy has wasted no time commenting on the matter, warning all Russian nationals within its premises highlighting the event as evidence of the "Frailty of the socialist system.\nNo doubt the motivations of the conspirators will soon reveal themselves, but for now, the world stands  shocked at such unprecedented events occurring within a major nuclear superpower."

putsch.4.t:0 "Marine-Parachutists Surrendered"
putsch.4.d:0 "Andre clutched his rifle, swung as if propelled by spring towards the window and fired indiscriminately. A hail of bullets stormed down on the invader below; a last act of annoyed defiance.\n\nThe fighting had been short and brutal. The Police prefecture, unprepared for a sudden armoured assault, was missing entire chunks of its foundation. Radio operators lay dead or dying on the floor, as the Gaurde Nationale charged inside; ants in feast.\n\nEach ricochet into the office triggered another set of rounds in return. It had become something akin to a game. Andre would hunker behind the desk, nursing the red oozing from his shoulder. A stray would fly overhead, sending chunks of wood from the cabinet across the desk and into his lap. Then an angry shout would erupt from his lips, two adrenaline filled legs would shoot up, and another clip would empty.\n\nEventually, down to his last bullet, he grunted, threw the rifle aside, and screamed with the last of his energy.\n\n"Come and see you traitorous shits!"\n\nA silence gripped the room for a moment as his opponents awaited another barrage. He chuckled a bit, happy he had instilled some fear in the bastards who served those bureaucrats. Finally satisfied they would encounter no further resistance, the stormtroopers sprinted into the room. Andre opened his eyes slowly, gazing up at the six barrels pointed towards his general direction.\n\nHe donned a smile and raised his hands. As far as life went, he had to say, it had been a pretty exciting one."
putsch.4.a:0 "Vive la France!"
putsch.9.t:0 "Marine-Parachutists Pacified"
putsch.9.d:0 "As the moon gave way to its brilliant orange stalker, the still air found itself under siege. Small at first, a chant grew in its fury, a low hum made deafening.\n\nA thousand voices stormed the cobblestone bridge; the route to the police prefecture.Their stampeding feet awoke all who slumbered inside, and if one were to keep a keen ear, then it could be heard that they were singing.\n\nDespite their size, they moved with purpose and tact. As seen from an eagle's eye, it was a thing of great beauty. A once formless mass, spouting wings and moving swiftly as it crossed the bridge, its left and right flank led by separate bearers of the red flag.\n\nThe center soon collided, overwhelming the scared and confused soldiers manning the front gates. Through numbers and song, they halted any chance of a fired bullet. Some could even be seen hugging those in uniform, gripping them tightly in both fraternity and anger.\n\nOn the flanks, ladders soon unfolded. Determined spiders, climbing past windows and balconies, entered on all sides.\n\nThrough it all, Andre smiled and drank. Taking in the sounds and sights as they descended upon him. Never before had he seen such an action of such grace and swiftness from the people. Regardless of whether the bastards from Paris had orchestrated it, he would not fire on civilians. They had gambled, and though he wished to bluff a strong hand, he had no choice but to fold. Thus, Andre's short reign came to an end, undone peacefully, and punctuated by whispered radio apologies to Pierre. All across the 4th arrondissement that day, there would be those that stopped to ask..."
putsch.9.a:0 "Vive la France!"

putsch.5.t:0 "Alsace-Lorraine Brigade Destroyed!"
putsch.5.d:0 "Heavy fighting has finally struck some common sense in their minds.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine Brigade has been completely restocked with other, more loyal soldiers.\n\nVive la France."

putsch.13.a:0 "Let's face our defeats without fear."

fra.5.t:0 "A Farewell to Arms"
fra.5.d:0 "He would not be citizen Louis Capet.\n\nSo it was that when  the mob of dusty workers, steel eyed veterans, shoe toting grandmothers, and passionate students began to assault the doors of the BGT building, Pierre approached the balcony with a megaphone. He looked out at the sheer size of the massive crowd, wishing they could only see in their government what he did.\n\n"Comrades" he began, before adjusting the volume of the megaphone "My Comrades!"\n\nThose closest to the building stopped their assault momentarily, and glanced up at the general.\n\n"I have undertaken this task in the name of the masses. However, It has now become clear to me that I do not possess their blessing."Pierre stared at the floor before continuing\n\n"French, French you honourable people.  My life I have dedicated to you. But, if it is the will of the citizens of Paris that my mandate be rejected, I have no choice but to obey.  I ask only that you march forward fearlessly toward destiny, united and proud as you have demonstrated today. Lets us sing the Marseilese - the most beautiful song, as for myself, i have no voice left"\n\nEven the distant crowd had quieted now, a phenomenon few other men could create. All eyes were upon Pierre. He smiled slightly, and began his ascent downstairs and into custody."
fra.5.a:0 "Goodbye, Pierre"
fra.5.d.b:0 "It was finally over.\n\nEdouard let the shotgun fall against his knee, staring at the towering presence before him. Though only moments before adrenaline had surged through his muscles like a knife, now he simply stood motionless. Unsure of how to proceed.\n\nThe general too was unmoving, as was everyone in the room. It mattered not how much carnage littered the floors below, for there was nothing but respect in the air now. Edouard himself was supposed to do the handcuffing, yet once  he had reached his target, the process seemed unfathomable. How could you arrest a living legend?\n\n"Comrades." Pierre stated simply, finally breaking the long silence "No need to make things messier"\n\nThus with a curt salute, and the adjustment of his hat, Pierre followed the men in tow, peacefully submitting to defeat. As the unit passed other soldiers throughout the building, they were greeted with only quiet nods, an absence of hatred towards their so-called "enemy". As they made their way to the door, Pierre finally stopped, staring at a series of crumpled bodies on the ground. It was here Edouard gazed upon the image he would never forget; the sad eyes of France's most controversial figure.\n\nFinally, the detour over, he stepped out into the light. As the armoured van grew closer, the general's stoic expression turned to a slight grin, and a voice bellowed from his lips.\The man who had just tried to overthrow the government was now proudly singing the La Marseillaise.\n\nThe Republic had survived, despite the calamity that had gripped the city. Yet, though he could not put his finFRA on it, something felt different. A sweeter air, a bluer sky. Pierre had lost, yes, but Edouard had a feeling his legacy would endure, somewhere far outside the walls of a prison cell..."
fra.5.b:0 "Aux armes... citoyens"

fra.50.t:0 "The Trial of General Pierre Brossolette and the Pustchists"
fra.50.d:0 "I can still recall the Smell. The Sight. The Sounds. Flashing bulbs, clacking typewriters, hushed whispers and cigarette smoke. It's all burned into my synapses, you see. I'll never need a photo to aid me. Of course it was a monumental day. It was the kind of day that divides your life into "before" and "after". You know what I mean?\n\nAh, but you kids already know all that. What you really want to hear is not how important it was, but how it all went down.\n\nThe part the textbooks leave out was the strangeness of it. I'm not sure you could call it a real trial. I think "Interrogation" fits best. When the big guy himself finally took the stand I saw the same look in the prosecutor's eyes that sat in mine. He scanned Brossolette carefully, eying him as if he were a prized possession. Pierre was the most fascinating man in Europe back then, an enigma to be unraveled. He had made a statement of course, but it still didn't add up. Why had one of the most respected war heroes in our current revolutionary armed forces betrayed his own government?\n\nHugo Beaumont, that was the prosecutor's name. Pierre first asked him for a light, and he obliged in a sort of awe. It took a moment before the questioning began. When it did, we all leaned forwards in our seats, every last one. \n\nPierre spoke quietly\n\n"Well, as you know, I took no joy in it.""
fra.50.e:0 ""You were notified of your reassignment on the 20th of April, correct?"\n"Yes. I was informed no earlier than any other member of the armed forces."\n\nHugo froze in his stride at the statement and stopped pacing. He turned away from the judge and toward the defendant.\n\n"That is misleading, is it not Comrade General? Official notice had not been issued, sure, but you knew it was coming. Your contact in the BGT told you, correct?"\nPierre became visibly annoyed at what he considered semantics and pointless diversions. Another drag of the cigarette underscored the scowl on his face.\n\n"Yes."\n"Why was it necessary to be informed ahead of time?"\n"You know damn well why."\n\nHugo sensed an opportunity to shift the conversation where he and everyone else had really wanted it to go. He decided not to press further on the issue. Pierre seemed ready to open up, and any good prosecutor would have obliged him."
fra.50.a:0 "Tell us, Pierre, why?"
fra.51.t:0 "The General's Reasons: Day One"
fra.51.d:0 "The trial had gone on for half a day now yet neither Pierre nor his listeners had lost steam. His voice carried unceasingly, pausing only for a rare question from Hugo or a drink of water.\n"Consider the economic situation, Comrade. The so-called "triumph" of the BGT. It was an achievement indeed, if you were an artilleryman. What of the local manufacturer? What of rural infrastructure? Of Housing? The federation had a legion of flaws, failure to care for the basic needs of its citizens was not one of them!"\nHugo took his advantage. "You of all people, Comrade General, must understand the necessities of the time. Had the Social Republic not constructed it's war machine, who is to say we would not become the Kaiser's pet subjects?"\n"Bah! Are those your words or Benoit Frachons? I was there, Comrade. I saw it, I lived it. Dysfunction lurked behind every corner. Military overproduction and industrial centralisation had forged the entire system into an absurdity. Take the example of my neighbor at the time. What was I to tell a man who laboured for a month to receive a voucher for bicycle parts, then found himself idle for weeks before it was delivered in poor quality?\n"Then there was the rationing, the harvesting and shipping of almost every foodstuff in the country to the northern cities. All this was before the war, mind you, when the only concern was keeping up the facade of prosperity. France had become a bountiful utopia, and to counteract enemy propaganda the whole world had to know of it!"\n"Be that as it may, Comrade General, growing pains in production are no reason to betray one's government."" 
fra.51.a:0 "It was heavy industry that saved France"
fra.52.t:0 "The General's Reason: Day Two" 
fra.52.d:0 "A picture of key individuals and events had taken shape. Hugo called a new witness to the stand, a Lieutenant Colonel.\n\n"Comrade, you served alongside General Brosolette in the occupation of Germany. Is that correct?"\n\n"That is correct."\n\n"And during that time, you claim to have had many conversations with the General off-duty" the Lieutenant Colonel nodded rather than repeat himself.\n\n"What did you talk about?"\n\n"Well we met most often over drinks. I wasn't alone in seeing him, of course, the General was quite a sociable man. It felt strange to be speaking so frankly with a superior, especially one who was otherwise stern.There was a whole lot of downtime then, between the occasional act of sabotage.

We both had very strong views.Yet there was no disrespect intended.

Neither of us preferred the federation of course, but Pierre believed that Semard and his Jacobins had gone too far. His favorite example was that of Charles-Auguste"\n\n"Auguste Bontemps, the Anarchist?"\n\n"That's the one. In the opinion of the General, the case of Bontemps underscored the entire problem with the Social Republic. Bontemps had been the lynchpin in returning the abstentionist faction to the BGT. He did so under the guise of compromise, with the promise that elected officers be permitted in the armed forces. Yet by 1937, not only had the decision been reversed, but the bureau had been expanded and almost every Anarchist had miraculously lost their seat."\n\nHugo noticed Pierre smile in the corner of his eye, as if a great truth had been unveiled."

Every material worth a thing goes to a war machine, a war machine that not only should no longer exist, but should never have been so large in the first place! A nation must have civilian production, it must never discard loyal comrades!"\n"Comrade General, there is not a single child in France who goes hungry."\n\"It is true. None are left destitute." Pierre paused for affect and articulation \"Yet it is also true that none are fulfilled. Industrial and agricultural expansion has led to a massive population boom. Millions of people toiling and raising families in service of our ideals. Yet what do they receive in return? A job in some Breton Coal and a rationing of every commodity.

Frenchmen had descended upon their former colonies, intent to liberate everything from Tunis to Casa Blanca and dislodge the final fortress of the old order.\n\nIt was in this same room in 1947 that the slog ended by armistice. The revolutionary army returned home in light of European matters.

The federation, though understandably too busy to deal with the threat, made frequent reference to an eventual “African Liberation”n\nEven in its earliest days agents of the Bureau considered the exile issue to be of the utmost importance to state security. The North African coast had become a springboard from which the  reactionary paternal mob could gather and plot. Many lengthy recommendations were delivered to the rapidly reforming CGT. It was because of these recommendations that formal plans were drawn up by High Command to eradicate the remnants once and for all.Yet these plans would fall by the wayside as the domineering Germans soon became the more pressing issue.\n\nThis changed in 1946. With the German threat gone and the troops still mobilised “Operation Starlight” was authorised. The operation was an initial success, and the pawns of the old elite were thoroughly routed from Algiers, Tunis, and Casa Blanca. They fled into the desert, and English and French forces worked together to chase them south.\n\nYet as the year dragged on the conflict turned into an endless slog. The Sahara itself was hardly friendly to supply and logistics for the troops. The rank and file themselves were exhausted, and having to dog in defenses surely triggered fresh memories of past stalemate in Europe. In addition, it became quite a costly endeavour politically and economically to maintain such huge mobilisation. Strategic targets had been secured. An armistice was inevitable.\n\nThe terms of the 1947 treaty demanded either dissolution or a complete withdrawal south by 1950. Following a bloodless coup in Dakar, the new exile government of Senegal-Gambia claimed it would fulfill the latter promise. Yet despite this, factional infighting and the enormity of the task seems to have prevented them from doing so.\n\nTime is running out for the exiles. They have requested to meet with the Communards in Oran, in the hopes of delaying the inevitable. With the French army having learned from its mistakes, diplomacy may be their only hope."

To have such a profession, one required a coping mechanism of some kind. Though sometimes he thought calling it a profession might be inaccurate. "Burden" held what seemed the correct syllables, as did "Responsibility". His superiors preferred the word "Duty".\n\nToday was a usual day. The two Brunos sat at their station, one cognizant and the other forced deep into subconscious recesses. They reviewed the launch protocols with Cecilia as was required, then discussed the procedure they had already discussed hundreds of times. Both him and Cecilia understood the purpose of such minutiae and as such took it seriously. The buried Bruno was regularly annoyed at its occurrence, though he would not be allowed to surface to voice such concerns. Ultimately, that was his purpose; a dumping ground for such thoughts. In addition, Comrade Cecilia would have to report it, and he would likewise report her for expressing such sentiments.\n\nWhen the formalities were dispensed with, the two could finally settle in for the day. They sat at their terminals, listening for any radio broadcasts and repeatedly checking in with high command. It was in these moments that the other Bruno surfaced in daydreams.Yesterday he had been a simple farmer toiling away south of here, in Marseille. Today he was a commando on the Belgian Front, serving alongside his brave comrades against the Russian Beast.\n\nSuddenly, the radio squawked to life.

In a few moments there would be no point in reporting anybody to anything. \n\nThere was still the possibility of it being a drill of course, yet she doubted it. When the drills came they did so months apart, and considering the situation outside an actual launch was far from implausible. Fuck. This was one of those points of division, a moment in time that divided one's life into "Before" and "After." She felt instant regret, for there were many things she had still wanted to do in the time "Before." Instead of those things, she would be a murderer.\n\n"Comrade," a stern faced Bruno spoke softly, his eyes piercing her soul. "the code book."

The Radio began squawking.\n\n"22A79B" it said. There was a short pause before it spoke again. Then another code "22A9FF."\n\nHer shaky finger traced the digits and she recited each one under her breath to steady herself. In the middle of the page she would find the second code.

If she kept it up the other Bruno, the one he'd buried, might rear his head. The first set of targets were insignificant and aroused little dread. Latitudes of Medditeranean islands and longitudes that led as far east as Lake Baikal. They were likely military installations, radio Towers, and perhaps naval repair yards. Though his brain had entered lockdown, his subterranean empathy rejoiced in reading these targets. He hoped against all reason that they would never end.\n\nYet end they did. Cecilia received it first; a target at 59.9311 north and 30.36.09 east. He knew of the city, having read about Peter the Great in his youth. Though it was illegal and improbable he had hoped it possible to visit one day when the Russian Regime had fallen. The nugget of empathy lurched painful daggers into his breast with the knowledge that there would no longer be a city to visit. Then there was Kiev, Minsk, and Warsaw. He assumed Cecilia had handled Moscow, because it hadn't come through his phone. Istanbul came last following a smattering of the Balkans. With the coordinates verified they got to work on trajectories and travel times. When that was done, they sat in brief silence. He thought of saying something to Cecilia, but did not.

In days past she had doubted his commitment to duty. Now, the thought was embarrassing. She had crumbled under the pressure and he had remained the same. How did he do it?\n\nThinking of Bruno partially reopened the floodgates She thought first of Bordeaux, her younger brother and their city apartment. Next of their father, the veteran who cared not for what banner France flew under as long as it was France. She had surprised him by joining the military herself after the war. The principles of Socialist gender equality were alluring; a chance to escape monotony. Escape became a divine purpose. As awareness developed, so too did conviction. The enemy was brutal, oppressing millions in the name of a few cackling vultures at the top. It was this passion that led her to follow orders, despite her rebellious streak.\n\nThe cause remained sincere, and she had to trust in its justness. They had not laboured to build a heaven only to see it end in fire. There must have been plans, secrets she was not qualified to know about. The struggle to build communism would not be abandoned for something as immature as an act of vengeance. They had expected the final attack of the bourgeoisie, counted on it in fact.

If you’ll indulge me, let me take you back to another chapter in our history, one that began in 1789.\n\nIt is the tenth of August 1792. The air itself has become electric. Since the great liberatory event that was the storming of the Bastille three years ago, the people have waited. Paris is a great tea kettle full of steam, and it is about to blow. There can be no more delays, no more moderate appeals. The time has come.\n\nIn a dilapidated castle on the banks of the Seine, Louis waits. He has now failed to flee the country for Austria, his wife’s homeland. A note has arrived from Germany some time before. The Duke of Brunswick espouses visions of fire and brimstone should harm befall the lame duck monarch. It is claimed that Paris itself will be raised to the ground.\n\nDawn.

The masses ripple; an elastic wave. They return fire a thousand-fold. By Midday the ammunition has run out. The dogs are butchered. Those that survive will find their date with justice soon. Inside the king is nowhere to be found. He has fled to the legislative assembly.

Paris itself lies under siege. The Third Republic arises as the bonapartists bow.\n\nFrom the streets a clamor rises. It is an indescribable force, an invisible understanding amongst the crowd. The cruelty known intrinsically by those who bear it, widespread too amongst the yearning hearts of millions of long dead toilers. Today, it persists in each and every corner where the Bourgeoisie and their lackeys have fled to lurk. It is both Ancient and modern, enduring and potent.\n\nThe streets are lined with barricades and behind each sits a rifle. Paris has liberated itself, people stand staunchly opposed to opportunist government in Versaille and the decrepit reactionaries alike. They are the heirs of 1789; the world's first true Social Republic.\n\nThe "Paris Commune" persists against all odds and predictions. Within its city wide borders old injustices are destroyed one by one. Workers have begun to run the factories and for the first time in their short lives the children have found time for play. Debt slavery is erased. The papal tentacles are hacked off, no more shall superstition sully the mind! The dream of a just society has begun to emerge.\n\nYet the Bourgeoise cannot function without their labourers. Their inevitable counterattack ensues. The dream is to be smothered via siege. Buildings bellow forth smoke, women and children face the wall, and men scream in agony as the barbarians descend upon them.\n\nTime’s march hoists the Tricolor above Hotel de Ville and ash settles in the gutters. The Versaille republicans have stabbed the masses in the back! They have rejected the mandate of the many in favour of the enrichment of a select few. The Ultimate betrayal will not be forgotten. There can be no more doubt; The Capitalists care nothing for the fatherland. To the ruling class the nation is but a tool. To them, there are only those that own and those that work."

Yet, It meant nothing.\n\nThe Bourgeoisie have forged the fatherland into a slaughterhouse in pursuit of new markets and colonial resources. Officials of the Third Republic try to dress the carnage with patriotic rhetoric. Their words are hollow. There is no Liberte to defend in no man's land. The army is ordered into futile and suicidal final offensives.\n\nThrough the CGT the workers organize clandestinely against the slaughter. With the absurdity laid bare the solution becomes obvious. The system rests upon belief and obedience. The Bourgoise act only through intermediaries, and they are few in number. A general strike commences across Paris. It is an organic expression of their natural tendencies.\n\nThe soldiers soon return home, battered and disillusioned. They are welcomed by Parisian crowds outside the Hotel de Ville. The cowards inside the building have already fled south. Amongst the kisses and softly waving red flags the workers take arms. Death to the jackals of avarice!\n\nThe great struggle for liberty ensues. Slowly but surely, the bourgeoisie are stripped of their minions and forced to the sea. The dream has finally been realized!

In one such branch was a round nest made of small thistle. It was there that a small tan bird pushed its way through four chirping hatchlings. She sang sweetly back to them to ease their fears.\n\nA low and sudden rumble began in the north. The sands shook with the hum of engine and the clanking of bulkheads.

In return he indicated the government's willingness to supply Canada with heavy industry, as well as formal membership in the European Phalanstere for resource sharing.\n\nThe Canadian minister grew irritated, claiming that France sought to use massive amounts of North American uranium to shore up its nuclear arsenal. According to him, the Douglas government wanted no part in creating weapons that would be used against innocent people. Jean attempted to clarify that while the arms race was indeed a priority, he was equally excited about the potential prospects for atomic power.\n\nThe Canadian government certainly could greatly benefit from being a part of the internal-european market.

As Zoe removed hers both of the men found their offers of assistance rejected. She knew it was not her diplomatic tact, nor her pedigree alone that had landed her this assignment. The socialists believed in total gender equality, and the Federal Council’s survival depended on a warm reception here. She couldn’t say no to them, but she could to these two. They were less experienced than her anyway. She would not be simply a diplomatic prop.\n\nThe man outside the plane greeted them warmly, clothed in a worn and dirty army uniform. He tried cracking jokes. Zoe and Matteo managed a polite chuckle. Nico was not impressed with such informality. In fact, it enraged him that they had sent such a figure to deal with what was to Bern, a vital meeting. His fellow diplomats did their best to calm the small spectacled fellow.\n\n Stuttgart itself was astonishing. From the car windows one saw masses of troops and civilians moving about and red flags fluttering from every balcony. They were draped casually yet far from disrespected. It was as if the entire city were a great big maze being charted by a frenzy by military convoys. Zeal permeated the air.\n\n Finally they arrived at the building. Inside, Soldiers milled about the halls and a far too loud political debate came from behind a wooden door. They passed by the commotion and entered a quieter room.

Neither would let Matteo speak now.\n\n“Did you think they would ask nothing of us!? We do not have enough leverage to refuse such a demand. They know it.”\n\nMatteo waited for them to finish before speaking. It was a lofty thing to approach the Federal council with.

So many party members, across so many ministries, all engaged in the sale of goods the population didnt even have access to for their own personal benefit! It was a public relations nightmare! If such revelations were to become public, they might rip the Jacobin government apart. Who knew how much damage the reformist opposition could do? A backslide into the federation suddenly seemed possible.\n\n Then again it was this Committee’s job to investigate and prosecute economic crimes.

FRA_industry_of_glory_desc: "Though it required much personal sacrafice and the end of the Communal Federation our industry has become quite the achievement indeed. Rapidly constructed in the leadup to war and completely transofmred the very landscape of the homeland, it is a source of great pride for our people.\n\n Now that the war is over, perhaps its time the people will enjoy the fruits of their nation's glory." 
FRA_bureau_level_3:0 "Bureau Power: Powerful"
FRA_bureau_level_3_desc: "The Bureau's power is greatly excercised beyond its constitutional regulation and is capable to both actions against enemies aboard and at home with the highest efficiency. However, our citizens are obivious of this fact still, and the Social Republic is at peace."

FRA_grandeur_construction_desc:0 "The granduer of France and that of the fame of our socialist labour is costly, but its a proof of the triumph of our ideology and our fatherland."

### Leaders ###

POLITICS_BENOIT_FRACHON_DESC: "Benoit Frachon is the status quo. He can fully chart his ideological development, as well as his personal growth, to the maturity of the French Left. There is no better embodiment of modern France. Whether such a status is a positive trait depends on who one asks.\n\nBorn into poverty and forced to work from the age of thirteen, Benoit grew into an anarchist organically. He would become heavily involved in trade union struggles from an early age. When the first Weltkrieg led the SFIO into the worldwide struggle between “patriotic” and anti-war socialists Benoit wisely sided with the latter. This decision would enable him to help organize the 1919 General Strike in Marseille.\n\nAfter the civil war Frachon found his utopian views slowly corrupted. His optimism for the Syndicalist Federation degraded as it became clear that the tyranny of capital had been replaced with the rule of a thousand petty tyrants. Often he would voice particular concerns about the divide between urban and rural communes.\n\nDespite these reservations however, Benoit did not come to support the Jacobin reforms initially. It was only after a steady barrage of positive changes, specifically in the areas of military production, that he was swayed. His anarcho-syndicalist leanings were abandoned in favour of Marxist ones.\n\nToday Benoit is a champion of the status quo. Like most of the moderate Jacobins he supports a decent amount of centralisation and internationalism. Frachon is comfortable in the Social Republic, for he has  always tailored his views to what circumstances have dictated. With the glorious French victory in the Second Weltkrieg, what better system could there be?"
POLITICS_WALDECK_ROCHET_DESC:0 "Waldech Rochet is the silent workhorse of the PRFT. For years he has been a staple of the state apparatus. He is powerful and reliable, yet some may characterize his personality as “uninspiring”. He has formerly served as the Minister of Agriculture, a position he greatly enjoyed alongside secretaryship of the Economic Crimes Committee. The source of his power comes mostly from the countryside. It is there he dedicated his efforts to bridging the Urban workers syndicates with the small peasantry. This has earned him a disparate network of supporters in the party and the fields. \n\n Criticism has begun to mount alongside notoriety. The more orthodox factions claim Waldech to be a peasant-minded sentimentalist in the workers revolution. Meanwhile the reformist factions accuse him of being a bureaucratic fool that cares only for petty matters, an example of the stagnant and diseased status quo. Change is coming in some form. Waldech will try and do the right thing."
POLITICS_JACQUES_DORIOT_DESC:0 "Jacques Doriot was once recognized as an early leader of the Jacobin party and a decorated war hero. Now he is known mostly as a jaded cynic. His belief in the system decayed steadily over the years, as did its belief in him. During his time as a party outcast he has maintained a close relationship with the moderate or simply anti-Jacobin parties. As a result, he transformed into an irk In the eyes of the leadership who found such ambitious ideas unamusing.\n\n Jacques has found a new gospel In the army, heeding Pierre Brosolettes call to remember France’s “two million martyrs abandoned by the state.” He still resents his de-facto expulsion from the establishment, and seeks to form a government free of party politics altogether. The vision of the putschist general lives on in him. Perhaps this time, it is with a bit of personal vengeance."
POLITICS_JEAN_PAUL_SATRE_DESC:0 "Jean-Paul Satre is a man not easily encapsulated.  During his time as minister of culture he became known as a prolific writer. His paradoxical views expressed in this time were hard to quantify. As a result, he would find himself an outcast in the very party he himself participated in.\n\nDespite this, Satre’s musings are never outright rejected. He commands a certain aura around him that demands respect and admiration. It is a charming presence of frankness and an inherent understanding of the troubled French minds, who in turn dominate the appendixes of the Jacobin Party and the youth as well as intellectual organizations of the Republic.\n\n Satre is an attractive machination of contradictions, and the recent circumstances have allowed him to gather a flock. Under his wing is the dream of a new future for the revolution, one that rejects both the opposition and the status quo. Satre himself claims no agency in the matter, hoping only to go where the people take him."

Modern France is nothing but a thin veneer, behind which bureaucrats backstab each other in an absurd byzantine game. His fire shall birth a fairer state. It is a vision of a French nation; united in its historical roots instead of divided between parties, cliques, and factions.

Over his lifetime, Andre has thrown himself wholeheartedly into many causes he found just. Whether he is writing passionate polemics or hunkering behind concrete with a machine gun, Andre can always be found dedicating his person to a higher cause.

Though he was a reactionary in youth on account of his upbringing, De la Vigerie saw the red sun on the horizon. He soon became a model reformed Aristocrat, living proof that anyone could become a comrade given enough time. Yet despite his genuine belief in the socialist experiment the state never fully forgave De la Vigerie for his past. He was monitored and distrusted. This rejection would combine with shrewd judgement. Over time he became a dissident again, this time motivated to save the system rather than oppose it ideologically.\n\nCommand: §YFlottille du Nord, Flotte de la commune§!\n\nLocation: §GCherbourg Naval Base§!"
