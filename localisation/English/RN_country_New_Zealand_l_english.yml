POLITICS_ELIZABETH_I_DESC:0 "§YElizabeth the First, by the Grace of God of New Zealand Queen and Paramount Chief of Fiji§!\n\nAlthough born in Canada in 1926, Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was moved to New Zealand at the age of 12, safe from the political instability of the eve of the Second American Civil War. Elizabeth has spent half her life in this corner of the Earth and is considered to be a true New Zealander, cheered and adored by the population - the little Princess was a symbol of Royalty, of peace and the Great British spirit, in a dark time of war and Imperial decay. When she was coronated in 1949 by the Provisional Military Cabinet, the young Queen, adorned with the uniform of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, rode on horseback through the streets of Wellington to accept the Crown, a warming image in these times when Empires have all but fallen to their doom."

### Events ###
nzl.1.t:0 "Elections!"
nzl.1.d:0 "We had our first elections earlier today, and the party that won is..."
nzl.1.a:0 ""
nzl.2.t:0 "Emergency Session of the Privy Council"
nzl.2.d:0 "Following the attempt on Her Majesty's life not too long ago by three NZRF affiliated terrorists, the Privy Council has been called to discuss the national policy concerning the NZRF. Our policy before the outrageous attempt on the life of Her Majesty was to bar the NZRF from official elections and political events, but there were no serious crackdowns on NZRF meetings. Of course, in retrospect many in the Council see this policy as fool-hardy, as it has apparently allowed the NZRF enough breathing space to organize terrorist activities. Many now push for increased crackdowns on the NZRF, but a few a  say that such measures would destroy the very notions of free speech and tolerance that our nation holds so dear.. On the countryside, the Guard have already begun arming themselves. We need to solve this problem before it collapse our entire kingdom."
nzl.2.a:0 "We have let them roam free for too long"
nzl.2.b:0 "The old policy will remain"
nzl.3.t:0 "The Republic of Australasia demand we cease all actions against the NZRF !"
nzl.3.d:0 "As we begin our efforts to crack down on NZRF activities by raiding their offices and arresting key organizers, the Australian government has voiced their outrage. They see our efforts to crack down on radicals as "infringing on the God-given rights of men to organize for their own liberty." They have demanded we not only reverse our efforts to crackdown on the party, but that we also legalize the organization. Of course, our government are opposed to this measure, seeing it as clearly trying to undermine our sovereignty"
nzl.3.a:0 "How about we dont ?"
nzl.4.t:0 "The Republic of Australasia demand we legalize the NZRF"
nzl.4.d:0 "Following our inaction against the NZRF, the Australian government appears to have been emboldened. We've just received a demand from their government that we cease what little action we are taking against the rebellious party and allow them to participate in our elections. They claim this is "out of an interest in seeing our Australasian brothers being allowed to fight for their rights" but this as an obvious attempt to subvert our government."
nzl.4.a:0 "How about we dont ?"
nzl.5.t:0 "The Australian Ultimatum"
nzl.5.d:0 "After several failed attempts to force us to bend to their will and rejoin Australasia, the Australians have sent forth a final ultimatum to us demanding that we either legalise the New Zealand Republican Front or face military action. The parliament has been thrown into chaos, and the Aotearoa Guard has mobilised and threatened to march on parliament if they bend to the will of the Australians and even The Queen herself has assembled her Privy Council and the Armed Force. And while the debate on how we should respond to the Australians rages on in Parliament and the Wellington Palace; mutiple reports of firefights between police and the NZRF have came in, further destabilizing the situation. The fate of our beloved kingdom looks bleak, to say the least. "
nzl.5.a:0 "Cursed !"
nzl.6.t:0 "The Crisis Continue"
nzl.6.d:0 "With the deadline of 2 months creaping ever closer. Australian Warships has been sighted around our coasts, the Home Fleet is on high alert with every possible personel. Meanwhile after 11 days of continuous debateing, a resolution to negotiate with the Republic of Australasia has been passed with a small majority. However the Guard and many National Party members have rejected the vote, believing it to be a betrayal to "Queen and Country", Royal Assent have yet to be granted but many believe that Her Majesty,who herself is targeted by the NZRF will not grant assent to such a compromise. The fate of our kingdom fall on one single signature that will define our history forever "
nzl.6.a:0 "The Resolution was granted Royal Assent, there will be peace !"
nzl.6.b:0 "On Her Majesty's command, the Guard stormed Parliament. Aotearoa will not bow !"
