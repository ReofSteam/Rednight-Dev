POLITICS_TE_LAWRENCE_DESC:0 "§YLieutenant-General T.E Lawrence - British Forces in Germany§!\n\nChairman Mosley considered Lawrence a potential threat to his power. This status was soon compounded by unsubstantiated allegations of a royalist conspiracy..\n\nSoon Lawrence found himself Governor of an occupation zone, a thinly veiled attempt to distance him from the Isles. Bitter over the loss of his R.E.D and the increasing grip of a man he considers cowardly, Lawrence’s once middling criticism has grown into an outright public disdain for the grand protector.\n\nRegardless, such complaints will never hold bearing on his commitment to duty.The administration of these territories is a new challenge, and like all he has faced before, it will be met with great vigor and the faintest hint of a smile."
POLITICS_PIERRE_BROSSOLETTE_DESC:0 "§YBrigadier-General Pierre Brossolette - French Forces in Germany§!\n\nDuring a short career as a journalist,  Pierre bore witness to the same bureaucratic infighting and corruption so detested in the Third republic. Dejected, he often wondered if France had simply traded thieves for bureaucrats?\n\nIn the decade preceding the second weltkrieg, Pierre enlisted in the people's army out of a strong desire to break the German reactionary hegemony. It was here he spent climbing the ranks all the way to brigadier general.Pierre is older now, and by all accounts tame. Away from the dogmatic revanchism of Paris, it was his dutiful and stern temperament that afforded him the role of an effective and productive governor.\n\nHowever, there are rumors. Hushed in whispers among militiamen and conscripts, visions persist. Perhaps there is  a different Pierre. One who, in his most private moments, still carries a passionate fire. According to some, the Brigadier-General is prone to lengthy monologues, extolling his pacifist desires, internationalist sentiments, and above all, a hatred of the talking heads of the BGT."
POLITICS_MARPAC_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Joint Occupation Zone; a revolutionary shield against the Russian beast. While it is crucially important, it is also incredibly chaotic. Military forces from all Marpac nations gather in this small area, awaiting the surely inevitable war to come.\n\nOversight of such a omni linguistic and disparate defense can be trusted to no single governor. Thus, the task falls to the Joint Control Council. Comprising military officials from four nations, it serves as both a high command as well as a civilian administrative body. Working around the clock to ensure professionalism between units, coordination, and fulfillment of needs, its burdens are grand. Things are never easy, but they are necessary. The council will not blink  in the face of its reactionary enemy, lest we all tumble back into the dark ages."
POLITICS_OTTO_GROTEWOHL_DESC:0 "Had any been asked to predict the future of the German Empire in the waning days of the second weltkrieg, no lips would utter the name Otto Grotewohl. Nevertheless, the mild mannered left-spd politician now finds himself head of the provisional administration in Hamburg.\n\nHistory has a funny sense of humour, a fact clearly evident to Otto when he was interrupted painting his new bicycle shop by two sharply dressed frenchmen. Since then he has been a unifying figure, working tireless and compassionately to mend old wounds between the KPD, SPD and FAUD.\n\nAs Otto’s term advances, it has become clear that the French government made a wise choice. Besides being an efficient administrator, Otto has become a soothing presence in uncertain and calamitous times. While his rule is unlikely to last forever, many in Hamburg will surely be sad to see Grotewohl go."

ger.0.d:0 ""An island" Dietrich stated, matter-of-factly. "Perhaps tropical, perhaps not. But an Island nevertheless!"\n\nSchmidt snorted with amusement at the foolish old man. "An entire island, only for yourself? Though I suppose that's typical, considering your difficulties attracting female attention."\n\nThe room erupted upon this remark, excluding Dietrich of course. Boisterous laughter  filled the starry sky outside the checkpoint, quieted by the renewed clinking of glasses.\n\n"What about you, Schmidt? Have you a grander plan then mine?"\n\nSchmidt pondered for a moment, furrowing his brow. Truthfully, he had never given it much thought. A socialist since youth, the prospect of a German revolution had served as his guiding star. Now that it had come, albeit by bayonet point, he hadn't the faintest idea of who he would be when the occupation ended.\n\nDietrich, pounced upon the opportunity. "Hah, is my island still so foolish now? At least I have an ide…."\n\n"Politics" schmidt stated bluntly. "I think I'd run for representative."\n\n"Representative of what?" Slurred Paul "As if any of us have the faintest idea when civilian governance will return, or what form it will take."\n\n"Whatever it is" Schmidt thought aloud "I intend to be a part of it.""

gerflav.1.t:0 "New German Cinema"
gerflav.1.d:0 "In the Immediate aftermath of surrender, wartime plans for several new government agencies were realized in Hamburg. Among these was the "Deutsche Filmgenossenschaft", a partially state managed film cooperative. However, as more pressing issues became apparent, the cooperative found itself lacking in both attention and resources.Now, as reunification looms, many within our provisional government have detected a new use in the war for hearts and minds. After speaking with officials that were once affiliated with the project, one man has dug up two potential scripts to be made into feature films.\n\nThe first of these is a part drama part biographical picture known as "Marx Und Engels" and follows the titular characters, portraying important scenes from their lives. While it is certainly not action packed, the script seems to have some solid dramatic legs, and will be certain to share a special connection to the German people.\n\nThe other option is more risky, though potentially more lucrative, being an action film. "Was hätte sein können" or "What could have been" is a venture into alternate history. Following a German defeat in the first weltkrieg, the left wing "Spartacist" members of the SPD, who were made irrelevant and exiled in reality, led a daring revolt against the Kaiser and other bourgeois forces in Kiel.\n\nCooperative officials have indicated that both pictures have had most of their footage shot previously, which is a part of the reason they were chosen. We must decide which film to polish and edit soon, if we are to screen it to audiences in time for reunification day."

ger.1.d:0 "Yes….That’s quite correct….no…. give me a countdown please…\n\nWorkers, peasants, and soldiers, I wish you all good morning. It is a good one indeed, for reasons that I am sure you are already somewhat aware of. Since the war’s end, your administration in Hamburg has worked tirelessly. There were many sleepless nights, a phenomenon that many across the breadth of Germany may find relatable. Today, we hope to put both rumor and civil servant to rest. What is to happen to the Fatherland, and when will the occupation end?\n\nIn coordination our allies’ civilian rule has returned to our nation.  A new constitution established with cooperation from all legal parties has now been ratified. As international forces begin their long trek home, we can now with confidence refer to ourselves as a “German Republic”. The character of this nation is to be assuredly German. She shall be free to make her decisions as a sovereign nation. Once, long ago, a Prussian socialist of little note claimed that we Germans possessed three cardinal rights. Among these were the right to be a soldier, the right to pay taxes, and the right to keep our tongues between our teeth. He spoke in a jest made possible by a dark reality.\n\nTruthfully, the Idea of a German Republic is not new. For years it has been an invisible undercurrent. It rested with those poor Bavarian scamps, doomed to lie amongst wire in service of a nation that cared not for them. It echoed in the hearts of mothers, forced away from their children to put food on the table. It flared in the actions of all the Rhenish workers, knights of labour willing to strike in the hope that a better world might follow. \n\nToday, we cast down the cardinal rights of old. The new German nation fights no more,  it shall speak freely and live by the fruits of it’s labour. Today is a victory for the common people. Among their new rights shall be freedom of assembly, and social ownership of production.\n\nMore Information will come in the days to follow. For now, we ask that you all go about your business. Remember to treat your comrades kindly and take a moment to breathe a sigh of relief.  Kaisers may come and go, but the German nation lives forever. Thank you.\n\n"

Men like that were simply shortsighted- to dethrone the satanic reds and their masters meant saving Western Civilization as a whole, not simply restoring the Kaiser.\n\nThe officer approached with his escort and began speaking. Though they were simply a ragtag group of guerillas, he never ceased to be impressed with the way his superiors conducted themselves. Their uniforms held no decorative emblems or crosses, but it often felt as if the war had never been lost. They were still members of the Heer, through and through.\n\n“Gentlemen. While my words today deserve to be uttered with proper cadence, you will have to excuse my curtness. There is no time for poetic language, I will leave that task to the generations to come.”\n\nHe noticed his comrade focusing intensely and felt a pang of guilt. He had been wrong to chastise his brother so harshly. He had forgotten the bigger picture; the greater enemy. In the end, they all served the same righteous cause and the same god.\n\n“Never before has our enemy been so weak. The Communards, in their arrogance, have abandoned their occupation of the Fatherland. The German Republic lies exposed in its infancy, ripe for liberation by our forces. The time of salvation is at hand. Werewolves, for death and glory, tonight the moon will rise!”\n\nHe grinned at the thought of open combat. No more cowering in the Alps. The pawns of Zion would soon meet their due…"

boz.0.d:0 "The Assembled ministers of occupation gathered today to discuss new mundane civil laws to enforce across the occupation zone, from appropriate pricing for cigarettes and turnips to youth misdemeanours and appropriate hierarchies of road signage. Train timetables, reconstruction plans, industrial planning graphs and before and after comparisons of growth in the wheat and barley sector all blurred together into a beige haze with numbers and letters losing all meaning in the bureaucratic soup. The excitement and attention in the room briefly on the mention of dynamite, only for it to turn to an issue of a lack of shipments for mining dynamite in the Luisenthal mine, and the room returned to its indifferent slumber and mumbling chitchat. \n\nSeveral ministers had to be prodded awake, as the meeting dragged on for hours.\n\nBy the fourth hour, General Lawrence had to have salts administered as Minister-President Blair addressed key issues in forestry and railway signaling bylaws. By the 6th hour all key issues surrounding appropriate regulations for abattoirs and coal mines were settled at last. Finally a somewhat comprehensive civil code for the administration of day to day life in the British occupation zone had been established."

boz.1.d:0 "In a wide plaza, beneath a morning drizzle, men stood in rigid formation. Uniform in expression, dress, and posture, they resembled the worshippers of some god or idol; A large central flagpole.\n\nDespite their homogenous and stoic appearance, each man held a flurry of emotions inside of him. For some, this signified an end to the long nightmare. The years of  boredom, interspersed with episodes of horrific violence ,were to be finally replaced with a simpler life as a civilian.For others, it was a day of sorrow, an end to purpose and camaraderie. A long adventure, abruptly punctuated by a morning flag ceremony.\n\nMinister Blair was no exception to the emotional turmoil that gripped the men of the plaza. A decade of work was coming to an end. He had witnessed atrocities, victories, defeats, acts of heroism and cowardice alike. Good or bad, the stress built up in his shoulders over the years was finally releasing, and a bittersweet smile covered his aging face.\n\nTwo men stepped forward, and the banner began to fall. Blair turned to his gaze to the right, looking upon an equally tired military governor.Like the others,  Lawrence's face indicated no significant strife upon a cursory glance. Yet Blair knew the man too well. The towering renegade's punishment was finally coming to an end. Soon, he would be back in command of his beloved R.E.D. Lawrence had seen this duty to its conclusion, like all others, and was likely ecstatic that the grand protector could cage him no longer.\n\nThe flag had finished its descent, and was slowly folded. Salutes followed, and the plaza erupted into claps. It was finally time to go home…"

foz.0.d:0 "So it was that Erwin Rommel; Infamous last marshal of the German Empire, surrendered once again. His opponent, a thin 300 page novel called "White Sun Over China" , had bested him five times. Doomed to a renewed life of boredom he shuffled inside, grabbed a beer, and returned to his balcony.\n\nThe cool air whipped through his hair, comforting in its familiarity. This he could understand better then any foreign utopian drivel. He gazed out across the city, taking in its aura. When had the world gone so mad that men might abandon a Fatherland such as this?\n\nFor a time, things were peaceful. He sipped his drink as he watched a French flag ceremony in the distance. It was an affair in which a particular private seemed to be struggling. He smirked at the lack of discipline displayed by the communards, for there was something self assuring within it.\n\nSoon however, the agonizing boredom of house arrest returned, and the newspaper was cracked open in his balcony chair. The headline caused his stomach to jump into his throat, and boredom became a burning rage.\n\n"Keitel to be executed after lengthy trial"\n\nErwin remembered General Keitel. He had been a suckup, a bumbling buffoon who jumped at any chance to kiss the feet of his Kaiser. At the time, Rommel had despised the man, suffering his annoying behavior only in the interest of his decent combat record. Now, he felt sick.\n\n"A goddamned execution?" He muttered "Are they truly barbarians?""

foz.1.d:0 ""Why must we have these talks?" retorted Rommel in his unimpressive french "You would speak to someone like me?" It wasn't the first time he had asked.\n"Of course, we are not so different, and regardless, it's nice to hear a fresh perspective, don't you think?"\nRommel turned to glance at the column of tanks moving slowly down the block. "No, I suppose we aren't so different after all" He paused for a moment. "How do you stand it?"\n"The dreadful naivete. You all speak of utopia, decry the fatherland, and yet..."\nHe gestured towards the passing vehicles.The smile on Pierre's face faded a bit, for he too understood the great irony. A flare of anger overcame him; a sign of a future yet to come.\n"France is a democratic state, a true one at that. Sure the bureaucrats may scheme, but we are building something, a new world for all humanit…"\nRommel sighed "I hear something similar daily.You destroy centuries of culture, all in pursuit of a dangerous and delusional project. The empire may not have been perfect, but we knew ourselves, and our place."\n"And what of the Indochinese? Ukranians? the Poles? the Rhenish workers? Did they know their place?"\nHe spoke quietly "there may be new faces, but men never change. Where once they were forced into our empire, today they are forced into yours.""

joz.0.d:0 "Clark  pressed his nose against the train window in childish wonder, doing his best to ignore the defeatist to his right. He had heard Berlin described as a "beautiful disaster" by his superior, but only now did the meaning of such a phrase crystalize.Beyond the pane, convoys bearing a thousand unique insignia travelled across tight streets. Beside them were the uniforms, tan, grey, and green alike and worn by men who crossed upon any opening. Additionally striking were the flags. Red banners of every shade, slung over hastily reconstructed buildings. Clark thought it resembled an ant-hill, ordered chaos.\n\nIt would be half an hour before they finally arrived In Berlin Central Station, coming to a sudden stop below its half-repaired dome. Adler, the cynic, let out a guttural groan."Oh get over it ya fuddy duddy!" called Franklin from two rows down "You'll make the rest of us look like stiffs."\n\nAdler scowled, and turned his face to Clark."He's right you know, today is supposed to be a celebration, not a vigil."\n\n"I did my time already" he muttered back "Only reason I'm here is outta respect for the militia"\n\nThe men filed out of their seats, grabbed their packs, and assembled on the station floor. Soon they found themselves before the Brandenburg Gate, flanked on either side by the tremendous thunder of clapping hands.Clark fought back tears as the twin jets streaked overhead. He understood his friend's cynicism, for the war had spared none. It came to him often, and with each closed his eyes and heard their voices.Today, none of it mattered. The night had been long and dark, and at the end of it all, he deserved a fucking parade. They all did. The first Americans in Europe! It was a day to remember, and a sign of things to come.Together, they would forge an earthly paradise greater than any heaven."

joz.1.d:0 "In the streets of Berlin, among a thousand vital operations, one man had been driven to madness. Like a hawk, Bruno stalked his mischievous prey. It was a dastardly fellow, an elusive bicycle thief that had begun toying with him since his morning biscuit. Since the war, Berlin had become a hub for foreign soldiers turned thieves, a fact clearly evident today.\n\nBruno grew tired of the game, and after casting numerous curses upon the enigmatic criminal he began to spring a trap. Appearing to have departed to return his equipment and retire from duty, he would instead be waiting patiently in an alleyway. When the man undoubtedly returned, he would fling himself upon the individual, finally securing revenge.\n\nIt would take many hours before his plan would come to fruition. The twilight kissed the horizon, and Bruno's dinner date surely felt abandoned. He felt foolish spending so much time in one place.\n\nHowever, just as he prepared to depart, the man arrived. Laughing with a comrade, he was unprepared for Bruno's ambush, and stumbled away. A chase ensued, and finally Bruno tackled the man.\n\n"Alright you bastard" he sneered "Which language must I use?"\n\n"German" the man replied angrily "I'm on leave from Forst!"\n\n Bruno gripped the man's coat and stared at the new flags upon the reichstag. He strived every day to represent the ideals of the Fatherland, and yet here stood a prime example of the lumpenproletariat that would undermine that mission."
