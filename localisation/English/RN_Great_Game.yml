greatgame.1.t:0 "The Great Game"
greatgame.1.d:0 "We have excellent reports coming in from the west. It is without any reservations that our military network within the borders of our Western American counterparts is growing day by day. Our analysts have confirmed with our agents and their circles that progress continues unhampered./n/nTruly, a tremendous sign that our cause is popular, and that the masses struggling in the West have hearts and minds turning to the greater good of humanity. However, what we have set to grow in hostile ground must not be left alone. Sooner or later, the West will react, and if we are not careful, our expanding web of human intelligence may wither and die./n/nFortunately, our comrades in the West have sent us, through secure couriers and trusted channels, requests for funding and other resources. They named it all: guns, ammunition, false documents, tools, pamphlets and other propaganda material, and so much more. Whatever they may want, it seems that we are able to provide. That is, as long as it is reasonable to do so./n/nMany of our comrades in the CIA are supportive of the decision to send our growing network more money and more materiel for their protection and their sustained efforts. But a few are wary; whatever their reasons, it seems that there is, according to them, much more to desire out of this network. Others simply believe it is too costly to help them out right now./n/nNo matter. It is up to us now to make the decision, be it for their sake or our sake. We can only hope that it shall not let down our cause./n/n"

greatgame.2.t:0 "The Great Game"
greatgame.2.d:0 "Our counterparts to the east may be skilled in the art of espionage, but unfortunately for them, we are better at this, and more so are we at countering their efforts. And thanks to their inferior techniques, their pitiful lack of experience, and their bad luck, the network that we've discovered and infiltrated is now a trap set for their beloved CIA./n/nWe suspected that this would be too good to be true, but beyond our wildest hopes, the Reds are buying our story. Soon enough, they'll send us the resources their agents requested./n/nIt's all too bad for them. They'll never get what they wanted, and they'll probably never see the light of day again. For as long as they dare to step over our borders and export their revolution into the West, we will make them pay./n/nLiberty will not waver in her struggle against the terrors of syndicalism nor shall she fail in her own games against the specter that enslaved Europe and now most of the homeland. While we cannot push out of the West to restore our great nation, we can trust in the activities of our own agents./n/n
The OSS will ensure that the West will sleep soundly, with all threats foreign and domestic quashed. Only time will tell for now as the CIA and their Red masters prepare their deliveries./n/n"

greatgame.3.t:0 "The Great Game"
greatgame.3.d:0 "There will always be threats to the cause of humanity. And among those who dare to press a bayonet against the heart of the worker and their rights are spies coming in from the West, bringing with them poisonous materials and ill will against the Socialist Republic of America/n/n
It is our responsibility to shield the people from their enemies, both foreign and domestic. And it is our responsibility to turn the evil of those who seek our destruction against them./n/nWith good timing, but also with the greater will of our agents, supported by the people, we were able to locate and discreetly arrest all the agents deployed by the OSS into our territory. And it is without excluding the unlikely but naturally soothing realization that the West has not found out about our efforts./n/nUnknowingly, they still believe that their network, which they set up some time ago, is still operational. Of course they would. Our agents have kept the channels open, and with some coercion, a wise few chose to collaborate with us so that their greedy masters won’t suspect a thing./n/nAs long as we keep these troublemakers behind bars or under the ground, and as long as they don’t try to figure out what has happened, the CIA is free to keep the parasites and their deluded agents in the dark./n/n"

greatgame.4.t:0 "The Great Game" #Russia
greatgame.4.d:0 "The American syndicalists believed that their CIA is good enough to play the game of shadows with us. They are wrong. Unknowingly, the only good thing they've done is send foolish men into the hands of our experts. They fed us with what money and materials they've been allowed to set their networks up with, and more was promised to arrive./n/nTheir cost is now our benefit, and it would be unwise for us to interrupt our amusing syndicalist friends when they are making mistakes. Better to keep them in the dark until we allow them to realize that they have been duped./n/nFor now, what we can do is to keep their brave little boys in our custody; as long as not too many try to escape or to fight back, there won't be too much need for them to recover the bodies. Their channels for communication and their call signs are helpful instruments in the sustainment of our maskirovka./n/nUntil we decide to make greater use of our own resources, and until we have achieved more political will to see to that and to the utility of our manpower, these syndicalists can keep playing with the ghosts of their beloved network./n/n"

greatgame.5.t:0 "The Great Game" #French
greatgame.5.d:0 "If only our Russian neighbors knew how wrong they are about their assumptions, then our invisible hand would have been bitten off. Fortunately for us, they do not know. What they only know are the lies we fed them and the rewards they think they will receive. Sadly for them, only a trap awaits their long-feared agents./n/nHad it not been for our friendship, our American comrades would have suffered humiliation at the mercy of these Russian bastards. And they are grateful for our assistance. Not everyone knows, but as long as they keep playing their part then we can keep up with our efforts at blinding the bear./n/nFor now, there's not too little time to waste nor too little money to spare. We know the Russians can be fooled, and when they are fooled, we know that we can act against them./n/nFor the security of our republic, and the peace of our American comrades, as well as the dignity of the Pact which we share with our Italian and English brothers-in-arms, the Bureau shall keep the shadows around the eyes of the bear, luring him out of the forest for our hunters to spot him and kill him./n/n"

greatgame.6.t:0 "Of Oil and Spies"
greatgame.6.d:0 "Comrades, we have news. Our network has succeeded in the destruction of one of our enemy's oil refineries. While our agents are still hiding in their safehouses, we can confirm reports from our enemy that significant damage has indeed been inflicted against the refinery. That is one less target for us and one more problem for them./n/nThis will severely hamper their ability to make greater use of their bounty. The capitalists will have to put up with lesser stocks of fuel for their people and their armed forces. It will also take them many days to repair the ruined plant./n/nFor now, this is a victory that we can all celebrate discreetly. The Socialist Republic of America can rejoice in the fact that our enemy has more to waste while our strength grows./n/n"
greatgame.6.a:0 "We will bleed them of their black gold."
greatgame.7.t:0 "Of Oil and Spies"
greatgame.7.d:0 "Those Reds will come running home to their handlers. They'll boast that their agents have done it. But all they're doing is fooling themselves./n/nIt is deeply upsetting to us, of course, that one of our oil refineries has been damaged incredibly. It will take us time to salvage what we can and repair what can be repaired. Our economy will take a hit and so will our military. But at least we can rest assured that this was just an accident./n/nNo way the Reds can claim this as their victory. We will have to tell the truth that it was an accident and nothing more. Still, that just won't get rid of the problem we have now./n/n"
greatgame.7.a:0 "Let's not burn daylight. That refinery has to be up and running again."
greatgame.8.d:0 "Of Oil and Spies" #French
greatgame.8.d:0 "The Government of the Western Territories of America publicly stated that the loss of their refinery was mainly and only mainly due to unfortunate circumstances. They do not believe that it was done by our comrades in the Socialist Republic, nor do they believe that it was done by anyone else. While they are correct about the casualties and the various losses they will have to endure as time comes for them to settle into the integrity of their economy and their armed forces, they are not with regards to what really happened./n/nIt is no accident that one of their finest oil refineries was put to the torch. And it is no coincidence that our comrades took the credit for its destruction. Both of their narratives suit our goal./n/n
The Bureau quietly congratulates its best agents for a wonderful mission. And as long as the ruse is maintained, both our American comrades and our mutual foe can rest assured that things may go well for them. That is, well, until we pull the curtains up and reveal the truth./n/n"
greatgame.8.a:0 "The best trick of the devil."
