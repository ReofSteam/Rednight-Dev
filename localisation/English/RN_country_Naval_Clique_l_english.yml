The Act so encoded the Dream of Return into the very nature of the Emergency government, entrusting the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the legal powers of Dictator.

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_WILLIAM_D_LEAHY_DESC:0 "§YChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Emergency Government of the United States of America§!\n\nWilliam Leahy never exactly asked for the job he was given. When he decided to assist in MacArthur’s coup against the President of the U.S. Leahy thought the job would be swift and safe, that it would protect American Democracy and ensure the best for all Americans. Rather, it brought him this. Leahy may not have asked for this work, but now that it has fallen on his shoulders he will do everything and anything to see it to the end."

usn.1.t:0 "The Emergency Government of the United States of America"
usn.1.d:0 "The Emergency Government of the United States of America has had a tumultuous and violent history. Formed in 1937 in the fires of the civil war by General Douglas MacAurthur, its history on the mainland was short. As Washington was besieged in 1939, the remaining members of Congress and the Joint Chiefs of Staff gathered to sign the Act of Return. The Act of Return is what gives this naval clique its legitimacy, giving the legal powers of dictator over to the Joint Chiefs of Staff until the United States can be restored. With the act signed, the remains of the government sailed for San Juan spearheaded by the admiralty under the leadership of Admiral William Leahy. There, they were greeted by armed rebels and revolutionaries, unwilling to accept their imposed rule. After 11 years of essentially an occupation of the island by the fleet which is the source of the clique’s power, the clique needs to change or it will collapse from the inside. If something were to befall the Admiral, the clique could either keep the spirit of America alive, or let it collapse in on itself."
