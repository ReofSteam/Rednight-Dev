AST_king_albert_i:0 "King Albert I"
AST_king_albert_i_desc:0 "After the death of Edward VIII and fall of Canada, with the Empire in shambles yet again, Prince Albert succeeded his brother and was crowned as King Albert I in 1943. In a huge shift of rhetoric from his father and brother, he de facto ended the war for the British Empire and refocused the Empire's loyalists to salvaging whats left of it rather than trying to pursuit the impossible goal"
AST_last_bastion:0 "Last Bastion of the Empire"
AST_last_bastion_desc:0 "The British Empire, a beacon of cooperation and enlightenment the world over, has fallen. Once mighty, we are resigned to our lifeboat, teetering among the crashing waves.\n\nWe may not be the generation that will restore our empire, but we will be the ones who ensured its survival. We must steel ourselves for the task at hand, stay true to our highest ideals, and guard closely against the socialist bastards."
AST_parliament_suspended:0 "Parliament Suspended"
AST_parliament_suspended_desc:0 "After the Battle of Melbourne-East, King Albert suspended federal and local parliaments in an attempt to restabilize and fix the country. While our situation has improved significantly since then, there are still active opposition groups and ways to go before democracy can be restored to our nation."

POLITICS_THOMAS_BLAMEY_DESC:0 "As our civilization was buried in the unceasing red tide, Australia too was gripped by chaos. Socialist agitators appeared across the continent, and it seemed the will of destiny that we too would be consumed. One man however, has reversed our fortunes.\n\nSince the 1946 crisis and suspension of Parliament, Thomas Blamey has carefully guided Australia. Through his time as head of the National Security League, dictator, and appointed prime minister, much has been done to preserve the last bastion of Imperial rule. Continued crackdowns on radical labour, combined with strong leadership and common sense policies have ensured a slice of old albion remains free.\n\nAs the Marshall ages however, many grow concerned. His once all encompassing hold on Australian politics is slipping, and he may not live long enough to see his ultimate task fulfilled.."
