IRE.2.t:0 "The Death of Michael Collins"
IRE.2.d:0 "The crowd roared and cheered and filled the air of mighty Croake Park, a score! Mayo looked to be on their way to winning the all ireland of 1950, my home county never failed to disappoint. My sweet grandchildren, they are blissfully ignorant of what i had to go through, to enjoy this. It was on this very pitch 30 years ago that the Tans perpetrated a massacre, during a football match like this one.\n\nA sudden sharp sound emerged over the P.A Loudspeakers, the cheering slowed as did the players when a sudden annoucement came roaring over us all.“President Collins has died, it was announced today and confirmed by the Sinn Fein party and the Parlirament.”. The sharp abrupt words were as if a bomb had fallen on the crowd, you could hear a pin drop, naught a sound but the rustle of the wind. Everyone held their hats to their hearts as did i, visibly confused and shocked and sorrowful. My grandchildren, bless their heart did not seem to know what was going on for the life of them, the eldest of them at a mere 6 years old, Fiacrah asked why the game had stopped for the president. I went into tears as words could not express what Micheal had meant for us, those of us who risked it all, saw friends and family brutalised and killed and homes burnt, and how Michael had become our leader, our guiding hand in the years since when the world burst into flames once more and cities in Europe were gutted and shelled. There were those then in the last war who said we should join in, on either side, drag our young and safe republic into the furnace. A moment passed and just as the minutes of silence ended the tricolour was torn from its mast atop the stadium by a sudden gust of wind, and drifted gracefully into the pitch."
IRE.2.a:0 "Who will lead us in these hours?"
IRE.3.t:0 "Chaos at the Ard Fheis"
IRE.3.d:0 "Brawling broke out today at the annual party conference of the Irish Republic's dominating party Sinn Fein between what can only be described as factions within the party, several men were injured before police arrived to break up the melee on the lobby floor of the Gresham hotel. According to members of the left-Sinn Fein factions, several representatives from the Seamen and Port workers union were invited to speak on events related to the crises in their industry by several left-Sinn fein TDs, yet TD Richard Mulcahy insists that these men had not been scheduled properly into the roster of speakers for that day, leading to confusion and arguments as to who was supposed to be taking the pedestal at that moment. TD Eoin O'Duffy from the party's rightinsisted that this taking of the pedestal was ‘an attempt to steer the party towards communist ends’ having long warned of ‘infiltration’ by ‘ red agitators’ and led several supporters and TDs in attacking the left TDs and Union representatives. Brawling then spread across the conference between groups of leftists, centrists and O duffy's private security. Police arrived roughly half an hour into the fighting alongside ambulances as several party members were seriously injured.\n\nAs a result of the conference none of the important votes for party leaders were able to be held, and selections for these positions will carry on without the votes of the membership much to the outrage of many TDs from all sides who are threatening to leave the party."
IRE.3.a:0 "De Valera will lead us."

IRE.10.t:0 "Battle of the A1"
IRE.10.d:0 "Protests over the expansion of Ireland's first motorway project turned violent today as police and Union protestors clashed in the Dublin suburb of Swords. The controversial highway project already rife with accusations of corruption and cronyism reached a new scandal over allegedly illegal eminent domain to several homes and fields along its route, with the owners not being rewarded due compensation by the government. A crowd of several hundred protestors, many of them from the ITUC and Labour party and students from DUC and Trinity, occupied the work site overnight, they were met with dozens of police in riot gear bearing teargas and batons as well as counter protestors from the right wing National Volunteers truck in from elsewhere. Provoked by either party, a violent clash occured and arrests were made. Leading some to accuse the police of co-operating illegally with thugs. The head of the Dublin National Volunteers, Captain Macmanus declared that they were simply there to intercept what they saw as a demonstration by socialist. The initial controversy over the highway expansion was soon forgottent.\n\nMore protests and pickets are planned with the ITUC declaring that unless the arrested union members and students are released within 3 days they will issue a general strike in Dublin. This initially minor issue has exploded and it remains to be seen if the National government has the capacity to handle it, and what drastic measures they might take"
