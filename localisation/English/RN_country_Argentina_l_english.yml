argentina.1.t:0 "The death of Uriburu"
argentina.1.d:0 "Calamity has struck our nation, our president, José Félix Uriburu has unfortunately fallen to a long lasting illness, and the nations now lacks a head of state to guide it. We must resolve this situation soon if we do not wish the socialists fall upon us like starving vultures and destroy our nation. Under normal circumstances, Lisandro de La torre, our Vice-President, should be the next in line to guide our nation, but this are not normal circumstances. Many of Uriburu's close friends and advisors misstrust De La Torre, as he has shown left leaning ideas, and has cooperated with socialists and radicals in the past. The coalition is divided, as many members do not wish to go against the constitutional mandate, nor against Uriburu's will, who had named De La torre his vice-president, others fear stopping De La Torre from taking power will destabilize the nation, or worse, lead to him attempting to overthrow the government"
argentina.1.a:0 "We do not wish to go against our constitutional mandate"
argentina.1.b:0 "The consequenses outgrow the benefits. Stop De La Torre"
argentina.2.t:0 "The presidential debate"
argentina.2.d:0 "Lisandro de La Torre has been successfully blocked from taking power. While marching towards the Casa Rosada, he was stopped by a small group of soldiers and civilians who demanded his resignation. With the problem of De La Torre out of sight, we must now answer the important question of who should lead our nation. From Uriburu's cabinet, there are two men that currently dispute the position of successor. Matías Sanchez Sorondo, his interior minister, supportive to the idea of Hispanic Corporatism, who has the support from the various paramilitaries that integrate the Coalition and from many of Uriburu's advisors, and Carlos Ibarguren, Uriburu's Brother in Law, a great afficionate of Italian Fascism and the Catholic ideals. The succession debate does not only involve these two men, as some other pretenders from other factions have spoken against them. the most important of these is Agustín Pedro Justo, one of the leaders of the revolution, who has the support of the more liberal sectors of the coalition. Finally, there is the Liga Patriótica, whose leader, Manuel Carlés, has abandoned political life after the revolution, but many within the government, like Anchorena and Varela, wish his return to politics, and claim he should be the one to save Argentina from anarchy, as he had already done in 1919. With a power struggle of this magnitude. How could Argentina avoid its downfall?"

Yesterday, in Rosario, a group of police officers broke into his house, where a meeting was taking place, with the objective of overethrowing the government./nWhen the police broke into the house, De La Torre attempted to shoot the chief of Police, Eduardo Paganinni, but fortunately failed and was arrested. He will be sent to life imprisionment in Martín García, alongside his co-conspirators Antonio De Tomasi, Enzo Bordabehere, Atilio Cattaneo, Severo Toranzzo and Francisco Bosch"
argentina.3.a:0 "Send our congratulations to Paganini"
argentina.4.t:0 "A rejected proposal"
argentina.4.d:0 "When asked by Uriburu's advisors to go back to his previous political life and take power, Carlés gave a negative response, claiming that his time had passed, and that he did not want to lead the nation, as the League was made to defend Argentina from the socialists, but not to lead it. With the gap left by Carlés, his supporters have turned to Justo, who they see as more similar to Carlés than the other candidates, while some of his more radical supporters have turned to Sanchez Sorondo"

argentina.12.t:0 "A mysterious man"
argentina.12.d:0 "While Lisandro de La Torre used to have great popular support, some of his recent actions have shattered this popularity, increasing the animosity between our government and the working class of our nation, which is something we cannot allow to happen. \nTo ease these tensions with the workers, the president's advisors had started scheduling visits to newly opened factories. De La Torre has been giving speeches in support of our economic independence and has been encouraging businessmen to invest in our national industry. Yesterday, a visit was scheduled to the city of Rosario, where he will give a speech in a newly opened Orbis factory. \nDe La Torre arrived today near noon, and while he was walking towards the factory, he was approached by a young man wearing a brown trench coat."
argentina.12.a:0 "What can I do for you young man?"
argentina.13.t:0 "Lisandro de La Torre is shot"
argentina.13.d:0 "When he reached De La Torre, the young man answered \"It is not what you can do for me what counts, but what you can do for the nation\". He pulled out a revolver from his coat and shot De La Torre twice in the chest, fleeing before the presidential guard could arrive at the scene. De La Torre was immediately transfered to the nearest hospital in Rosario, but unfortunately, he did not survive the assassination and died of blood loss. As mandated by the Law of Acephalia, our Vice President has taken the govenrment, and has promised not to let this insult against our nation go unpunished"

argentina.14.d:0 "When he reached De La Torre, the young man answered \"It is not what you can do for me what counts, but what you can do for the nation\". He pulled out a revolver from his coat and attempted to shoot De La Torre, but he missed twice, and was unable to shoot before being injured in the leg by one member of the presidential guard. \nThe would be assassin was confirmed to be Raul Alberto Lastiri, a young employee of YPF, but we do not know his reason for this attempt, nor if he was working alone or if he was serving a bigger purpose. \n Chief of the Santa Fe Police, Eugenio Puccio, announced that he would investigate this assassination attempt"
argentina.14.e:0 "This is a miracle"
argentina.15.t:0 "Coup attempt discovered"
argentina.15.d:0 "The National Coalition had, in the last months, been taking more and more power from the president, Lisandro de La Torre, but it was believed that it was just guidance for what they wanted, turns out we were wrong. \nIt was discovered today that many important figures of the coalition, including Matías Sanchez Sorondo, Carlos Ibarguren and Manuel Fresco, were planning a silent coup against the president and the cabinet, to finally take full control of our nation's government. \nDe La Torre has ordered the immediate arrest of the conspirators and has begin an investigation of most of the members of the former coalition, as Juan Emiliano Carulla and Isaac Rojas declared that the coalition is dead, withdrawing the support of the army and the PN to our government, with the paramilitaries following suit. Fortunately, it is not all bad news, as the Democrats and the Liberal Officers have declared that they stay loyal to our government \nIt seems that the greatest crisis yet has struck Argentina, and this time it has not come from the socialists, as we have always feared, but from our own government."
argentina.15.a:0 "This is a calamity"
argentina.16.t:0 "The coup succedes"
argentina.16.d:0 "We had been planning a silent coup against De La Torre for the last months, and it has finally been put in practice. Our conspirators, led by Ibarguren and Sanchez Sorondo have taken control of the government and put Lisandro de La Torre under house arrest. \n Following our advisors, De La Torre will stay as the formal president, while the real power will be held by a junta reepresenting the interests of the coalitions. This junta will be integrated by Matías Sanchez Sorondo, Carlos Ibarguren, Julio Meinvielle, Juan Bautista Molina, Julio Irazusta, Felix Cafferata, Gustavo Martinez Zuviría, Hector Benigno Varela, Emiliano Carulla and Isaac Rojas"
