Up for grabs is the chairmanship itself, alongside numerous minor posts and positions for representatives in the TUC.\n\nDespite calls for increased democracy intensifying and international condemnation of the Mosleyist administration building the prospects of change still seem doubtful. To international observers It matters little whether the English Socialists, Mosleyites, or National Labour candidates prevail. The Chairman’s grip seems to never wane. His clandestine influence is as thick as a suffocating cloud. It survives on backdoor schemes and  a powerful groundswell of patriotic support. Still, on the fringes of British society scattered student groups, regional union representatives, old fashioned politicians rally for change. Can the Black sheep of the socialist bloc overcome the repressive wartime status quo?"

A universal armistice dubbed colloquially as the "New Year's Peace" began its reign a few hours ago. It was birthed with the signing and ratification of the  "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostility and Exchange of Prisoners-of-War in the North American Continent."\n\nJournalists familiar with the conflict have been speculating on such an outcome for around a year. Their speculations were spurred on by a seemingly endless stalemate along the Eisenhower line, the daring destruction of the Trans-Canadian railway and the untimely passing of the constitutional president Jack Reed.\n\nWith the confirmation of these insights comes uncertainty; How long will such an armistice last?"

His unifying presence and guiding hand in its first decades ensured the young republic did not fall into factionalism. Even if many have accused him of using dictatorial and authoritarian methods to achieve such goals, few doubt his vision of neutrality in the world war and peaceful co-existence have been highly successful"

RN_intro_fra_1:0 "From the electric, dangerous, and joyous opportunity that was the Great Imperialist War, the revolution arose. Though the war had given life to the globe, and workers councils could be seen from Petrograd to Rome, the Parisian workers took the first step. It was from a frankenstein crucible of hope and horror that the §BFrench Federation§! was born in 1920.\n\nYet the Federation wasnt utopia. While quality of life in the local communes had improved, the authority of the §YCommittee De Salut Public§! and the §YCGT§! itself were farcical. Stagnation and incoherent policy gripped the young syndicalist republic in its early years. Initiatives to combine the efforts of the metropolitan and rural communes often ended in frustration by both parties. The military was practically nonexistent, comprised of a hundred disparate militias with conflicting goals and doctrines. The tyranny of a thousand tyrants gripped the economy, preventing large infrastructure projects. Things functioned, yet they never well. Each commune seemed content with itself and the surrounding suburbs. It would not be sufficient to stave off the bourgeois counterattack. Something had to change.\n\nSlowly but surely a band of the frustrated grew. On the fringes of society there were those who found themselves disillusioned with the anarchistic nature of the Republic. France was the world’s example, and it was not setting a good one. §YPierre Semad§! saw what the status quo politicians and union bosses could not. He gathered his Marxist §R"Jacobin"§! faction to stand as opposition. It was a grassroots effort. Though they had existed since even before the general strike and 1919 revolution, throughout the 1920s they would grow.\n\n1936 would be Semads triumph. As the §gAnarchistes§!, and §OTravailleurs§! bickered amongst themselves, the Jacobins presented a cohesive program. As the worlds first Proletarian state, the one that had inspired revolutions amongst their foreign comrades, France had a sacred duty. She would become a valiant defender of the revolution, a shining example of what the united proletariat could do. It was only they who could combat the encroaching threat! The 1936 CGT elections were a total upset.The §LSorelians§! were and arrested, for they had attempted to destroy the Federation.\n\nWhat followed is now known as the §Y"Year of Changes"§!. Major reforms were implemented across the country. The existing constitution was respected. The establishment would fall in line, excepting the ever troublesome Anarchistes, who underwent a brief abstention until they were promised elected officers in the armed forces(a decision that would later be reversed without notice). A §Y"Union Sacree"§! it was dubbed, a nickname born from the annoyance. France gained a new centralized government and economy, elected via universal suffrage in the CGT. Long term success would soon render the critics helpless.\n\nThe new government realized that while understandable, the stigma against intelligence agencies was only harmful. Therefore, meager structures would also be reorganized into the Bureau for the Suppression of Counter-Revolution or §RThe Bureau.§!. Despite the name, the Bureaus chief concern was not the internal security of France, but an scheme to spread the revolution across the continent.This was primarily conducted under the secret §YOperation Lumière§!\n\nThe war came in 1939 with the §YAlsace Crisis§!, and the long feared German assault was realized. Through sacrifice,subterfuge, and attrition the day was won. No more would France and her allies be pariahs. Riding high on euphoria, the French Federation became the §BFrench Social Republic§! in 1947. France was an atomic superpower.\n\nOn the surface, things are perfect. Yet by 1950, resentment stirs. The years have created absolute Jacobin domination. Accusations of corruption and overextension rear their head. For now they remain quiet, smothered by the status quo captain §YBenoit Frachon§!."

RN_intro_eng_1:0 "From its conception in 1925 to the dawning days of 1936. The Union was always controlled by the former elements of the Labour Party and its associate groupings like the Independent Labour, the National Socialist, etc. Led by men like Phillip Snowden, whose vision of a revolution and socialism are limited to say the least, yet his position and his government is ever more precarious with the charge of treason hanging from the royalist and the charge of counter-revolutionary, a Kerensky of England as it was declared by the ever growing radical left from the opportunity and fervor after 1925.\n\nThe Snowden government pursuing a moderate Labourite path to sociaism eventually would come to a boiling point with those that violently oppose it. As such was the conspiracy of June 14th, 1936. Several Republican National Militias units, long a hotbed of radical with its lack of structure and command marched on the capital joining force with a large part of the union. However, R.E.D command also intercepted a conspiracy by the royalist elements in the military to use the opportunity to defend London to seize the Government and launch a counter-revolution. Thus calling the military to the defend of the Government seems almost implausible, but in this chaos, Secretary of Home Affair, Oswald Mosley would save the day after his speech to a large mass of strikers convinced them to turn back and cut the transportation of the Middlesex Regiment to prevent a counter-revolution. Then with his own volunteer militia - the Revolutionary Guards and the police, they barricaded the roads to the city blocking the rebellious militias. Delayed and disorganized, the rebel militia dispersed after loyal units from Wales can be recalled. While with the main royalist conspiracy force - the Middlesex Regiment stranded and eventually surrounded, its leadership gave up after news that the city is safe and calm.\n\nIn the aftermath of the two successive coup attempts, the Government of Phillip Snowden resigned. Triggering an election that Mosley easily sweap up with his popularity, charisma and more importantly the backing of the Labourite who saw him as the one capable to bring about a true English Socialism. Thus Mosley officially took office as the Chairman of the Union in the summer of 1937.\n\nThe Mosley Government quickly declared itself to full backing of the French-led revolutionary reforms. While strengthening the R.E.D, Mosley also got rid of elements dangerous to him by sending them to France to take part in Operation Lumire and the subsequent war as the Strategic Warfare Assistance Department, among these most notably would be the director T.E Lawrence himself.\n\nA new economic plan drafted by Mosley known as the Revolutionary Industrialisation Program aimed to solve the failing British industry following the lost of the capitalist market and a decade of shifting major focus to he Home Isles's agrarian problems. The plan also included the rearmament of Britain for the coming war and the defense of the Isles. The Republican Army was centralised and put directly under the Government and the incorporation of the new Department of Political Warfare, leading to the disbandment of all Republican National Militias in place of a new British Revolutionary Guards, thus eliminated most of the radical left's attempt as formenting independent military power."

However, by 1936 this unstable republic would suffer its final death blown with the world economic crisis of 1936 and the assasination of Aleksandr Kerensky, the deeply unpopular populist's death created a period of extreme chaos in the country owning not to anyone grieving the late president but the factional fighting of those who has longed for this day. With the country dying rapidly with a paralysed government, more than 30% of Russian would wake up with an empty belly and a lost job - mass suicide followed soon after. In this chaos however, one faction would ultimate win the day, later that year on March 21st, a secret conference in Saratov would be called for the right-wing parties and forces in Russia, its chairman is no other but the first soldier on the frontline against Bolshevism, Lavr Kornilov. Presided over a room of familiar faces, Boris Savinkov (NPPR), Pyotr Wrangel, Boris Brasol (representing on behalf of the Black-Hundredist Officer Union), Ivan Illyn and other people. There a common program was jointly signed titled “The Rebirth of Russia”. Two weeks later from the secret conference, the assassination of its Mayor shocked Moscow, as the second most high profile death in city from assasination, however, more threatening than the death of poor Fyodorovich, this death was publicly taken responsibility by a certain Bolshevik combat group that styled itself the “Lenin’s Young Chekists” and was wholeheartedly cheered on by the RFSSR  Government-in-exiles in Paris, but later investigation conducted by French Bureau revealed suspicion about the existent of such entity and its relationship with the Bolshevik Underground. Regardless, the investigation by the Okhrana was quickly suspended, and the case forgotten with the event happening 2 days after it. On April 6, 1938, the streets of Moscow were packed with a large entourage of officers, military and police decorated and lined up to form a direct path to the Duma Building. Wearing his old Civil War uniforms, with flowers thrown upon, Lavr Kornilov entered the Duma in a reminiscent of the old day before the Reds Rebellion. A document was presented to the Duma, on its cover “Resolutions of the 16th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)”, it presented a conspiracy about the alliance and reconciliation with the “Democratic” and “Progressive” forces of Russia named directly as the Mensheviks and the SRs in an effort to topple the weakened reactionary regime as its weakest to proclaim a new Socialist Soviet Republic. With that the Duma is henceforth disbanded, to be replaced by a Government of National Salvation. And in his first decrees, as the last president of the Republic, to dissolve it, and to outlaw both the Mensheviks and the SRs to form the Russian National State and declared himself the Vozhd of All-Russia.\n\nReactions to the implementation of the April Decrees were hostile as first, especially by its victims with the SRs returning to terrorism and claimed the life of hundreds in the Year of Sulfur, most notably Denikin and Savinkov. But peace and stability returned to Russia in the end, with the series of governmental reforms, agrarian reforms and industrialisation no longer hindered by parties politics and assisted by the broad of capable ideologues and intellectuals in the time known as the Kornilov Years. This also formed the foundation of the  Five-Headed Regime that continued to govern Russia.\n\nKornilov passed away from a heart attack on April 7th, 1948. 2 years after his holy duty to Russia is finished and a new world order in which Russia is a pillar is established. But under the shadow of Kornilov's lavish funeral march across Moscow, his pupils plot. The power struggle between the factions of the Regime and within the Kornilovites themselves only ended 3 months after his death, with Wrangel, Kutepov and various old guards forced into "retirement" while a large numbers of Black Hundreds and Savinkovists setenced to death for treason in the Petrogard show trials. The young faction of Kornilovites emerged as absolute victor and its face are the two duo, Nikolai Skoblin - the Vozhd of Russia and Mikhail Levitov - The Marshal of Prussia.\n\n"
RN_intro_prs_1:0 "As 1945 dawned it became clear that the war was lost. Forces were desperately diverted East and west to buy time. The Heer general staff prepared plans for continuation of government. However, their initial strategy soon became untenable. With more and more of the colonial garrison being drawn home to defend the Fatherland, Oberbefehlshaber Mittelafrika was unable to prevent their colonial borders from receding.\n\nLater that year, more forces of the Ostheer found themselves pulled west to reinforce the collapsing front. French troops had fully broken the beleaguered defenders. They were undersupplied, surrounded, and terrified by the FRAs rapid march across the Rhine. The new units were told to assemble at the new Elbe defensive line.\n\nOn the 5th of September §YErwin Rommel§! was promoted Field Marshal rapidly and assigned to the defense of Brandenburg. What remained of the Westheer would be reorganized into the "Panzerarmee Rommel". This maneuver would buy time for the government and the caravans of refugees evacuate themselves to the few unoccupied territories.\n\nNovember brought yet another disaster. The Austrian K.u.K army was obliterated by a joint offensive in the Solvene mountains. Without the aid of the K.u.K Army Group Southwest was entirely trapped and surrounded.\n\nThe 8th of December saw the first shots of the legendary §RBattle of Berlin§!. §YAdmiral Karl Von Doenitz§! was made interim head of the navy during this battle. Doenitz was be promoted following the murder of his predecessor in the Kiel Canal, part of a raid by the so called "§YFree Germans§!" of the KPD. However, this promotion only enraged him.\n\nDoenitz and his "§YNational Defense Junta§!" swiftly decapitated the feeble civilian government in Konigsberg, the provisional Capital.  The Naval Commander Doenitz presented §YWilhelm III§! with two options: oblivion under red occupation, or negotiation with the Russians.\n\nDiscussions with the Kaiser reached a stalemate until January, with the battle of Memel. The Lithuanian and Baltic reserve armies disintegrated. Russian soldiers had now breached Prussia proper. Admiral Doenitz and his cabal were instantly validated. Wilhelm was forced to relent.\n\nMoscow received a memo the next day, the now infamous "§RSecret Dossier§!". Russian Troops advanced through Southern Prussia virtually unopposed as negotiations occured, arriving on the outskirts of Berlin. Yet they were too late, as the French had already captured the city.\n\nAs was expected the Vohzd bundled extensive demands with the armistice. §RThe Reich itself would be disbanded§!, a move deemed unwise considering it would anger the German people and delegitimize the new regime. Yet the Russian political situation demanded it, and so it was. Another demand was that of a §Rco-occupation§! of East Prussia. Moscow, fearing resentment from their Polish allies, could not allow the new §gKingdom of Prussia§! government to be entirely autonomous. The occupation was met with even more furious protest. In a few incidents these protests turned into outright violence.\n\nYet the co-occupation could not sastiate the vengeful Polish government. Despite the orders of Moscow they mobilized for a brief war. Here the mettle of the new state was tested, and with Russian help it retained Silesia before a ceasefire was forced by Moscow.\n\nBy 1950, the health of Wilhelm III  has deteriorated due to the wound he received during the Rhineland Campaign. Admiral Karl von Doenitz is now  Regent and Chancellor of the interim provisional government until Prussian sovereignty could be reasserted."

RN_intro_world:0 "It is 1950. A new decade dawns alongside the §RNew Order!§!!\nThe Scarlet banner, so long smuggled in attics and championed in factory halls, flies proudly. Unfurled across the world like a blanket, it has nearly smothered the trembling holdouts of the capitalist system. With the fall of the §gGerman Empire§! the classless, stateless, money-less future heralded by Marx and Engels seems now to be entirely inevitable.\n\nFrance is the world's example. Paris is its heart, beating vigorously. On the streets anarchists, marxists, opportunists, exiles and patriots alike mingle. §YPierre Semad§! and his Jacobins hold current ideological supremacy. Riding high on victorious ecstasy, they have christened what was once known as the French Federation Into the §BFrench Social Republic§!. It was their centralising reforms that ferried the socialist movement through the storm of war. Yet now that the fighting is over, will the state tighten or loosen its grip? Captain of the status quo §YBenoit Frachon§! has set out to answer that question. So too has has the fiery General §YPierre Brosolette§!.\n\nAcross the Dnieper, the §GRussian National State§! lurks untamed from its hunnic masters. The old lands have been repurchased with blood. It was the aging Vohzd §YLavr Kornilov§!, who brought salvation to the people. Then, with his destiny fulfilled, he embarked towards a higher plane. The subsequently less powerful government of §YNikolai Skoblin§! has strived to follow his compassionate example. Beneath Moscows wing many have gathered; crowned heads, petty tyrants, loyal minorities, and warriors of tradition alike. All who stand against the red hordes shall be given a place. Yet such a disparate crowd breeds debate, and without the guiding hand of Kornilov debate has become hostility.\n\nThe situation in Africa can only be described as total disarray. In the north of the continent colonists battle with indigenous nationalists for the shell of Goerings empire. Some forces are more consolidated than others.The §ONigerian Federative African Republic§! has stabilised itself following a student uprising in Lagos. The nations young leaders harbor grand Pan-African ambitions. If they can overcome the conservative attitudes of the north and the hostile forces that surround them, they may see their dream realized. In the Sahara, the forces of §CSenegal-Gambia§! prepare to defend themselves from Europe. Governed by the last of the French exiles, the regime of generals continue to furiously debate the safest course of action before both their luck and time run out.\n\nAsia has liberated herself from imperialism, yet its future too is disputed. The legacy of Xinhai has been secured by the new §ORepublic of China§!. Yet the many petty warlords have hardly ceased their activities, instead opting to jostle for power within the facade of the Republic. §gJapan§! continues its imperial ambitions, having made puppets of the Philippines and Transamur by taking advantage of their power vaccums. In Indochina, Vietnamese interests have grown to dominate the left Wing §BIndochinese Union§!. These interests tend to turn a blind eye towards the interior, much to the chagrin of Laos and Khmer.\n\nNorth American sits bitter, exhausted, and divided. Baptised by a near apocalyptic war, the eastern §RSocialist Republic of America§! east grapples with reconstruction. §YJack Reed§! has passed away. §YWilliam Z Foster§! ascends as the legitimate President of the United States, elected by the rump Chicago senate. Though it is likely the new constitution will soon abolish such a position. In the west of the continent sits the §BUnited States of America§!. The precarious regime is built upon compromises. Macarthurists, Longists, and Pacific politicians bicker behind the closed doors of the §YThomas Dewey§! administration. Yet all these factions agree on one thing; §RThe Grand Trial§!. The factors that doomed old Uncle Sam must be categorically defined and eliminated.\n\nThe Final Struggle approaches; an atomic battle for the very soul of Humanity. Let it begin..."
RN_intro_pardan:0 "During PARDAN 1, the nuclear war will take the shape of a limited nuclear exchange.Only a small number of warheads will be allowed for the player to use during this phase. These warheads would be delivered via strategic bombers using the vanilla nuke system. However, we have made some changes to the damage of these vanilla nukes. In essence, the vanilla system still exists but has been revamped.\n\nRegular nukes now destroy any and all army units stationed where they explode..Regular nukes will also create a temporarily impassable zone, representing the initial nuclear shock. These zones will be cleared after a few days. This mechanic will force you to be considerate when nuking the frontline, lest you accidentally wipe out your army alongside the enemy. Nukes are not toys! They are however a great tool to stop enemy offensives and destroy their units if you have troops to spare. Remember that the nuclear shock is also a window of opportunity to fill holes, so it won’t be a one-way street.\n\nPARDAN 0 is the endgame.\n\nAll restrictions on nuclear weapons are lifted at this stage, first for the losing faction and next for the winning one. You will gain access to the entire national stockpile and to the ICBM and salvo attack decision panel. The ICBM panel will provide you with a list of targets that you can launch devastating salvo attacks on. However, to initiate such a launch the player must complete a complicated procedure.\n\nFor balance purposes, you need to repeat the launch procedure before each ICBM salvo attack. During this critical phrase all bets are off. The enemy will be forced into a desperate slog, and must rush to capture your headquarters as fast as possible before the nuclear devastation is unsalvageable. Remember that while the winning faction has delayed access to the salvo attacks, they will retaliate as well, so it's a gamble you as the player must take.\n\nSome additional notes regarding salvo attacks. ICBMs are a resource and should be considered precious. Each attack will consume a number of nukes from your available stockpile. Also, a salvo attack will render the damaged area permanently destroyed and unusable due to the more destructive payload.. The impasse will never clear, as it represents a high concentration of nuclear fallout as opposed to a single tactical detonation.\n\nFinally, sometimes the ICBM attack might fail to destroy the targeted enemy city. In such a case the player is allowed to attack said location in the next launch cycle. With another strike you may knock it down for good."

We managed to rescue a few survivors, all of which recounted quite a harrowing tale. They claim to have been attacked by what was first thought to be a coastal patrol. This was in fact a group of pirates, who boarded and seized the ship at gunpoint following their inconspicuous approach. Several members of the crew, though not all, were herded onto lifeboats, which our navy spotted and picked up.The status of their ship itself was confirmed many hours later, as it was found drifting empty of cargo near a small Indonesian Island.\n\n Maritime security has greatly deteriorated in the west pacific alongside the decline of global trade. This situation has gotten worse since the evacuation of the Kriegsmarine’s Ostasien station. It was also certainly affected by the chaos of the Indonesian national revolution, and  Japanese expansion in the pacific.\n\n It is unknown just where these pirates originate from. The survivors claim that they spoke a strange language reminiscent of German and English, but that it sounded mostly like gibberish.This incident is a loss to our economy and a humiliation to our national pride."
