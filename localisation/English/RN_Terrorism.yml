terror.1.d:0 "Yesterday, a scuffle broke out in the Grand Hall of the International, as the Italian delegate Amadeo Bordiga proceeded to insult every single member of the Congress with harsh terms such as \"comfort capitalist\" and \"opportunist\". He ended his rant by throwing his shoe at one of the social democratic delegates from Sweden. Needless to say, he was removed from the Hall."

terror.2.t:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Flight of the Republic"
terror.2.d:0 "Published within the last few years as a once fringe title, Flight of the Republic has risen to prominence as a greatly successful read amongst western readers on both sides of the Atlantic. Set in a world in which the British Empire still reigns over the globe, it tells the story of innocents living in fear of the mighty Union-Jack. After crushing chances of freedom in France, the British are back to patrol the globe and guard their holdings on every continent imaginable. But is the empire so strong as people think? Does the penetrating hum of Liberty drift from across the Rhine? Or will the eternal Anglo whip the masses back into their breadlines? Find out in ‘Flight of the Republic’ today!"

terror.3.t:0 "A last Stand"
terror.3.d:0 "Patriotic citizens can today breathe a sigh of relief! Here at Pravda news we are pleased to be able to report to you the cause of the numerous noise disturbances in Riga yesterday. Bolshevik terrorist Andrei Gromyko is dead!/nA member of the elusive so called “Reorganised Marxist Combat Union” national authorities have sought after him since the end of the Great Patriotic War. After becoming indoctrinated by traitorous peasants in his village of Gomel during the first Weltkrieg, Gromkyo masked a long life of cowardly criminal actions alongside his comrades. Most grisly among them were his attempts at spreading dangerous propaganda among factory workers at the height of the great patriotic war, as well as his role in last year’s tragic Babruysk fertilizer plant bombing. An event which killed 35 and injured many others.Since then, authorities have used every resource available to them to track down the organization’s members. While others such as Vasiliy Averin were successfully stopped before they could do more harm, many more have fled or dispersed into hiding. Such was the case for Gromyko, who was discovered to be pitifully squatting in an abandoned apartment complex in Riga./nAuthorities stormed the building from three sides and made their way to its upper floors, encountering the man on the 5th. A brief shootout ensued, explaining yesterday’s noise complaints. Thankfully, none of the brave few entrusted to capturing the subversive were harmed.The Red-Devil may still lurk across central European borders, but thanks to the actions of our police, it remains  unable to spread its poison to the motherland itself. Citizens are reminded to report similar subversive activities to authorities, wherever they might encounter them."

terror.4.t:0 "The Irish Embassy has been taken hostage!"
terror.4.d:0 "This morning seven armed men stormed the Irish embassy at Grosvenor Place! The staff have been taken hostage and appear to be unhurt. Within half an hour the embassy was surrounded by dozens of armed Metropolitan Militia officers. The terrorists have identified themselves as members of the Ulster National Army (UNA). Several hostages were released a few hours after the siege began in return for some minor concessions from negotiators. Presented on national television, these demands include the release of all Political prisoners associated with the Ulster independence struggle, as well as safe passage out of the country. We must be swift and decisive in our course of action. SAS units remain on standby, but others have suggested we negotiate and risk any unnecessary violence. This view compounded by the fact that the siege is being broadcast live from several TV news crews and a disastrous failure would be witnessed by the whole world."
terror.4.a:0 "We do not negotiate with terrorists! Send in the SAS!"
terror.5.t:0 "Hysteria in Nice"
terror.5.d:0 "“I was prodded forward. Hands pressed aggressively into my back, hands belonging to two maked men. The first held a torch, the second an old iron sword. Both were placed upon a table, which itself was draped in fleur-de-lis and tricolor flags. There was never such a moment before, where I had feared for my life so greatly....”/n/nHysteria is growing in Nice and its surrounding southern provinces following a startling expose by renegade French journalist Gabriel Petit. Petit alleges he was inducted into a secretive reactionary organization, apparently active since the early days of the revolution. Known as “Organisation secrète d'action révolutionnaire nationale.” Petit claims the group was preparing bombing campaigns across Eastern Europe and the newly liberated  North Africa, no doubt designed to cast the social republic in a bad light.This organization, while thought inactive, is not unknown to French authorities. Supported by the bourgeoisie government in Algeria during the early 30s, Its membership has been responsible for numerous horrific incidents. Among these are the assasination of the Italian journalist Carlo Rosselli and the bombing of steel plants immediately following the weltkrieg.While some have dismissed his claims as ludicrous, Petit’s account has inspired enough hysteria within southern France to warrant offical police investigations. Time will tell if there is much to uncover."

terror.6.d:0 "On a quiet road in Pärnu County, a calm wind rustled tall bushes. To any outside observer this was simply another in a long list of idyllic forest roads. On a normal day, they might be right.Today however, something lurked behind the forested landscape. If one listened closely, they could faintly make out subtle whispers, nervous murmurs, stomping boots.An hour passed before the low hum of the engines could be heard. The murmur quieted, the shapes retreated behind the trees, the stomping stopped.The convoy arrived slowly. Its inhabitants foolishly inebriated, celebrating nothing in particular. The first car, a buggy full of chanting men, would be a prime target.Panic erupted as two large logs fell across the gravel road. Some men ducked beneath their seats, others cried, some tried to escape. All was in vain, as the hail of bullets descended upon their helpless victims. So it was, Adolfas Ramanauskas and his “Forest Brothers” had struck again. After looting the bodies, they melted back into the woods. A scattering that befit their namesake./n/nAn hour passed, and the forest was yet again truly quiet. A chorus of chipper birds and buzzing insects sang. Unaware of the carnage below.Finally, a car door opened. A lone russian stumbled off into the woods, sobbing. Command would hear of this, that much he was sure of. Soon he would bring the entire garrison down upon these ungrateful bastards.Pärnu County roads are quiet again...for now."
