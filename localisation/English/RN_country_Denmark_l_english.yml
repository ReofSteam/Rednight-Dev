DEN_influx_refugees:0 "Influx of Refugees"
DEN_influx_refugees_desc:0 "As the German Empire collapsed, business leaders and aristocrats rushed to escape the oncoming socialists and voynists. From Austria, Germany, and even Italy bourgeois capitalists, nobles, and those who fear socialism were let into Denmark. While it will take time to settle them, they will be of benefit to our economy."
DEN_thriving_social_democracy:0 "Thriving Social Democracy"
DEN_thriving_social_democracy_desc:0 "Since the ministry of Thorvald Stauning, Denmark has made a number of democratic reforms and introduced a thriving welfare state. The Danish people trust the Social Democratic Party to lead the nation, and in turn that has led to economic prosperity through the 2nd Weltkrieg. However, as the new world order is shaped, and friendships must be made with other nations, some wonder whether Social Democracy is up to the task."
DEN_lack_trading_partners:0 "Lack of Trading Partners"
DEN_lack_trading_partners_desc:0 "Our main economic partners were all in Mitteleuropa. Germany and Austria have fallen, and with them our trading prospects. We must consolidate the friends we have in Scandinavia, Ireland, and Quebec by trading wherever we can."
DEN_iceland_question:0 "The Iceland Question"
DEN_iceland_question_desc:0 "Iceland has been in a personal union with us for decades now, but as it is in a strategic location in the North Atlantic there are those on both sides of the world who seek to align it. We must ensure that that does not happen."

POLITICS_FREDERICK_IX_DESC:0 "§YBy the Grace of God, King of Denmark, the Wends and the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, Lauenburg and Oldenburg§!\n\nBorn in 1899 in the age of old Europe, Frederick became crown prince just prior to the Weltkrieg in 1912. He would serve as heir to the throne through world wars and revolution, witnessing unprecedented change to the European order. Yet through it all, Denmark has remained a peaceful and prosperous nation. Now, as King since just 1947, Frederick must secure Danish peace and prosperity against an increasingly aggressive Russia and a new order in the West."
