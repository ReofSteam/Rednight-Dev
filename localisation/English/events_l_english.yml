 Uob.1.d:0 "Captain Nicholas Mosley, Republican Army will now speak!" 
"Dear comrades, fellow servicemen and all citizens, today is a historic day for our country, for its celebration of our recent civic feast of the industrial congress election have just passed and we are ready to steer our ship of state to a new direction and that direction have been made clear by the will of the nation in the ballots across factories of Britain. 
The people of Britain are behind their dream, the dream that was formed by my father in the fateful days of 1937, a Britain glorious and free, freed from the shackles of poverty and fear, my father has promised you: win the war and the world will be ours. But the people was not ready then, the war was still taking its toll on our people and we missed our chance to turn its fiery fire into a new revolution, the Comrade Chairman heard the voices of the people and we have waited but now, now is the hour and now is the time.
We, the soldiers, the hero-workers can not wait any longer before the fire of our unique opportunity for national mobilisation to pass away, thus i call upon the ministers of the state, the civil servants, glorious workers and farmers, our brother-in-arms still fulfilling the honourable internationalist duty across Europe, i call this upon you: Unite! Unite! Let’s us go forward as crusading regiments, armed with the fervent spirit for righteousness to reign forever on earth!"
