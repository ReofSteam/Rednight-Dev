NOR_careful_shot_socialism:0 "A Careful Shot of Socialism"
NOR_careful_shot_socialism_desc:0 "Norway is undeniably a social democracy to its core. It is a strong welfare state and the Labour party has been in charge for over a decade now. There is however a twist to their success and longevity. The Communist Party has been part of the ruling coalition since the early 40s, having steered through the economic troubles of the previous decades."
NOR_swedish_exiles:0 "Swedish Exiles"
NOR_swedish_exiles_desc:0 "NEEDED"
NOR_king_haakon:0 "King Haakon VII"
NOR_king_haakon_desc:0 "It is seldom that a King is chosen by his people. It is even more seldom that a Kind suggest he be chosen in the first place. Such was the way that Haakon VII of became sovereign however, as in 1905 he was elected by referendum as King of Norway. For 45 years he has reigned as a model constitutional monarch, forgoing the executive powers the constitution gives him in favour of engaging in purely nonpartisan activities.\n\n When Norway suffered during the wake of the Entente loss in the Weltkrieg, Haakon served as a neutral and uniting figure for the rheeling nation. Even when the Labour party at its most radical briefly formed a government in 1927, the King declared: “I am also the King of the Communists". When the Second Weltkrieg ended in disaster yet again for the Norwegians, who had been forced to align with Germany out desperation, Haakon was again proved ever vital in ensuring stability. His tours around the nation and regular engagement with his people, provided an escape from what many believed to be the beginning of a socialist invasion. The King’s actions even saved the government enough face to not be utterly trounched in the following elections.\n\n While Haakon continues to tour the nation and speak to his subjects, he is not the man he was during the chaos of the early twentieth century. Indeed, the country is experiencing a great deal of peace. Norway is unlikely to find itself in another war, the economy is only getting better and it seems that the communists in government are quite docile. Haakon should be able to enjoy his final years in peace…"
