INS.1.t:0 "Insulindia in 1950"
INS.1.d:0 "The Islands of the Gods, the Emerald of the Equator, the East Indies, Insulindia. All those names refer to the Seventeen Thousand Islands that lies between Asia and Oceania, between the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. \n\nFor hundreds of years, the islands have captivated the Indians, the Arabs, the Chinese and eventually, the Europeans. Though the first three nations have heavily influenced the cultures within the islands, the last one, the Europeans, had placed an iron yoke on Insulindia, specifically the Dutch. \n\nFirstly, the Dutch came to trade, but slowly but surely, the Dutch would create a colonial state stretching from Atjeh to Papua and would oppress the natives for three hundred years, until they fought back hard, in 1936, the Insulindians, led by Hoesni Thamrin, would revolt against the Dutch. \n\nThe revolt would end in failure and would bring new and horrible suffering in the form of Johannes Furstner. The suffering would last six long years, until a new revolt erupted, one mightier and much better organized, led by Soekarno, the current president. It was called the National Revolution. \n\nThe National Revolution would see the Dutch expelled from Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan and the Sunda Islands. It was filled with many great battles, betrayals, and heroic figures from both sides, and indeed, Insulindia is a nation built by the blood of its heroes.   \n\nBut now, the heroes have died for more than a year, and their blood dry and their bones turned to dust. If Insulindia, wants to last, it needs to change now."
INS.1.a:0 "Thanks be to God"

INS.2.t:0 "Rise of the PKI"
INS.2.d:0 "Ever since Musso and his clique’s failed putsch, the far-left has never gained many supporters, especially with Murba and Masyumi’s ever-growing popularity. The failed putsch also caused the SOBSI, the sole far-left organisation to be banned, and many socialist supporters to come flocking to Murba. \n\nThe SOBSI would find itself in an eternal state of decline, until Semaun was approached by the “Three Musketeers”, Aidit, Njoto and Lukman, all young Insulindian-educated intellectuals. Together, they formed the PKI or the Partai Komunis Insulindia from the remnants of the SOBSI."
INS.2.a:0 "We need to watch this closely"

INS_cabinet.1.t:0 "Fall of Natsir's Cabinet"
INS_cabinet.1.d:0 "The parliament is in an uproar earlier today when Mohammad Natsir decided to announce his resignation. After a series of confrontation between the Masyumi and PNI, stirred in part by Soekarno himself, Natsir decided that if he stayed in power, he would only do harm to the country, and decided to resign. \n\nNatsir and his Masyumi seem to have lost favour with Soekarno, who deems their attitude in the parliament “domineering” and their policies dangerous to national stability.  One source even reported that Soekarno gave Natsir two choices, to stay and risk national stability, or to resign “for the greater good”. Now we know which one Natsir picked."
INS_cabinet.1.a:0 "Appoint Tan Malaka to create a new cabinet!"
INS_cabinet.1.b:0 "Ali Sastroamidjojo is the right man for the job!"

INS_cabinet.2.t:0 "Fall of Tan Malaka's Cabinet"
INS_cabinet.2.d:0 "Despite having popular support, Tan Malaka doesn’t seem to have the backing of the government itself. Despite having the support of the PKI, the PNI and even Soekarno himself, that support base seems to have disappeared overnight as he had just tendered his resignation today. \n\nAfter massive contentions with the ACAMA, the Military, led by Dzulkifli Hasan seems to have enough and decided to march on the Parliament, with artillery cannons even pointed at the building itself. When the madness finally reached Soekarno’s ear, it was too late. Tan Malaka’s government is no more."
INS_cabinet.2.a:0 "The PNI should finally lead!"

INS_cabinet.3.t:0 "Fall of Ali's Cabinet"
INS_cabinet.3.d:0 "It would appear that Ali’s comradeship with Soekarno is gone, for earlier today, Ali resigned after the Soekarno himself came to the Parliament and demanded his resignation. This was an incredible act, and most of the parliament is even on Ali’s side on this, even Tan Malaka and Natsir protested at this decision. But despite that, Ali resigned anyway. \n\nWhen Soekarno heard that Ali had made deals with the Military behind his back, he was furious. He deems it a personal betrayal, done by Ali, an old comrade of his, no less. Though somehow, the Military survived the entire scandal unscathed. The same could not be said for the central government, though, as this scandal is sure to create a crisis."
INS_cabinet.3.a:0 "Unfortunately, we need something new."

INS_cabinet.4.t:0 "Fall of Wikana's Cabinet"
INS_cabinet.4.d:0 "Wikana looked battered when he left the Parliament today. Earlier, his entire premiership was torn to shreds by an unlikely coalition between Tan Malaka, Ali Sastroamidjojo and Mohammad Natsir, who each took turns to plunge a dagger in his leadership. He was expunged from power after a vote of no confidence, which was opposed by the scant few PKI representatives. \n\nThe triple coalition now awaits Soekarno’s actions, who is definitely sure to be displeased."
INS_cabinet.4.a:0 "This isn't working!"

INS_cabinet.5.t:0 "The Presidential Decree"
INS_cabinet.5.d:0 "The fall of Wikana’s government has prompted Soekarno to take “extreme measures to save the country”. With all the parliament seemingly defiant against his will, Soekarno has decided to disband the parliament.  This morning, Soekarno announced a presidential decree, and it’s contents are: \n\nFirstly, the disbandment of the Insulindian Parliament. Secondly, the creation of the Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat Sementara, or the Temporary People’s Consultative Assembly to “replace” the Parliament. Thirdly, he would announce the creation of a new constitution, based on the constitution of the First Republic and some of the original drafts of the current constitution. \n\nThis decision caused an immediate shock in the government, attracting criticism from a lot of people, even from the Vice-President, Mohammad Hatta, who called this move to be potentially dictatorial, and would subvert the decade-old republic, but what does he know?"
INS_cabinet.5.a:0 "You live long enough to become the villain..."

INS_cabinet.6.t:0 "Natsir Secures Second Term"
INS_cabinet.6.d:0 "Mohammad Natsir’s cabinet had managed to push their agenda, the creation of the unitary state of Insulindia successfully. Natsir said that this is really all he wishes to accomplish, but many within his party pressed him to ask Soekarno for a second term. Expectedly, Soekarno would grant this request, as the Masyumi’s political victory had just soared their influence within the parliament, and Soekarno approved of this. \n\nThough their move to integrate the islands is successful, actually integrating Insulindia into Insulindia is a much harder job, and that the higher-ups of the outer provinces aren’t very happy with the arrangement, as shown in the entire Andi Azis debacle. Should anything happen, this is a mess that Natsir had created, and one that perhaps only Natsir can fix. Either way, the road ahead for Insulindia, no, Insulindia, seems bright."
INS_cabinet.6.a:0 "Incredible!"

INS_cabinet.7.t:0 "Tan Malaka Secures Second Term"
INS_cabinet.7.d:0 "With the ACAMA in the streets, Soekarno’s approval in the palace, and great control over the parliament, it would seem natural that Tan Malaka and his Murba would secure another term in the Parliament. After a series of slow but steady political plays, Tan Malaka has secured the Parliament for himself and gained near-dictatorial powers. \n\nOnly time will tell what Tan Malaka would do with these powers. Would he do good, or would he try to undermine and subvert the republic, just as Natsir and many others fear?"
INS_cabinet.7.a:0 "No surprises there.."

INS_cabinet.8.t:0 "Ali Secures Second Term"
INS_cabinet.8.d:0 "Ali’s victory against the Dutch has immensely boosted his popularity among both the people and the politicians. Gaining support from the Masyumi and the Murba, Ali decides to seek another term, a move that would definitely be supported by the parliament, his party the PNI, and his superior, the man himself, Soekarno. \n\nAli promises to integrate the provinces gained after his diplomatic campaign against the Dutch. With the backing of Soemitro Djojohadikoesomo, a great economist, he would also try to improve the economy. With many promises and plans made, it is clear, that with Ali, Insulindia’s future seems bright"
INS_cabinet.8.a:0 "Congratulations!"

INS_cabinet.9.t:0 "Wikana's Appointment"
INS_cabinet.9.d:0 "Natsir, Tan Malaka and Ali have all failed to create a government that would benefit the people and uphold the nation. It would appear that neither the Masyumi, the Murba, nor even our own PNI could fix the problems of the nation without causing another. We need a radical solution. \n\nAidit, the leader of the PKI, has approached us with a solution. He asked us to give the premiership to Wikana, a member of his party. Ideologically, he and his party are very close to Soekarno, and they seem to be loyalist yesmen. Perhaps we should agree to this proposal?"
INS_cabinet.9.a:0 "We have great expectations..."

INS_cabinet.10.t:0 "Leimena Appointed Prime Minister"
INS_cabinet.10.d:0 "With the disbandment of the Parliament and the creation of the MPRS, Soekarno has consolidated control over the entire country. He decided that he would rule it himself. But, he would definitely need help to do that. Soekarno has decided to appoint Moluccan nationalist, Johannes Leimena. \n\nAlong with him, Soekarno also assigned a lot of “loyal Soekarnoists”, mostly from the PKI, some from his own PNI, and none from Murba or Masyumi. This cabinet was dubbed “The People’s Cabinet” by Soekarno and “The Soekarno Cabinet” by everyone else, basically calling it a puppet cabinet."
INS_cabinet.10.a:0 "A puppet, but still a prime minister regardless."

INS_parlemen.1.t:0 "Aidit and Natsir Clash!"
INS_parlemen.1.d:0 "Things got heated in the parliament as the Prime Minister, Natsir, engaged in a debate with PKI leader, Aidit. The debate originated from disagreements about a policy. As things get heated, Natsir raised the court gavel, seemingly threatening Aidit, who responded by standing up and raising his chair, as if preparing to throw it. Both were later restrained by Ali and Tan Malaka, who both quickly defused the situation by quickly disbanding the parliament. \n\nOddly enough though, they were last seen in the night biking together towards their homes which are coincidentally near each other's, acting as if nothing happened."
INS_parlemen.1.a:0 "Debates are healthy, but grudges aren't."

INS_civilwar.1.t:0 "The Resignation of Mohammad Hatta"
INS_civilwar.1.d:0 "Mohammad Hatta has been the Vice-President of Insulindia for a very long time. He had accompanied Soekarno since the days of the National Revolution, he was also the First Prime Minister of the United States of Insulindia, creating an emergency, ragtag cabinet to make sure that the nation can function properly. \n\nA democrat, he had criticized and often tried in vain to talk Soekarno out of his stubbornness, his view that Insulindia’s democracy must be guided by himself. Hatta’s role had also grown to represent the non-Javan islands in the new cabinets that Soekarno formed, with Hatta being considered as the only thing keeping their heads free from a Javanese yoke. \n\nNow, with Soekarno’s outright rejection of true democracy and establishment of guided democracy, Hatta had enough. He had decided to resign from his office of Vice-President. Only time will tell how the other islands may react to this."
INS_civilwar.1.a:0 "The Duumvirate falls..."

INS_civilwar.2.t:0 "Rise of the Regional Councils"
INS_civilwar.2.d:0 "After the resignation of Hatta, many provinces, mostly in Sumatra, suddenly panicked as they thought that they would be defenceless from any infringement of rights from the Central Government. This has caused many Colonels, leaders of the local military district, to create a sort of “dewan” or council, with the official goal of protecting local stability and helping to develop the province. \n\nThe most notable of these councils is the Dewan Banteng of Ahmad Hussein in West Sumatra, the Dewan Manguni of Joop Warouw in North Sulawesi, the Dewan Gajah of Maludin Simbolon in North Sumatra and the Dewan Rangkong of Andi Petta Rani in South Sulawesi."
INS_civilwar.2.a:0 "Alarming.."

INS_civilwar.3.t:0 "Reports of Ethnic Clashes"
INS_civilwar.3.d:0 "Report have arrived from around the country about an alarming rise in the number of ethnic conflict cases. Earlier this week, a Javanese family was assaulted in Medan by the local Batak families due to unknown reasons. In Padang, a Javan neighbourhood was pelted by the local Minang community. Even in Djakarta, there are reports of extortion and robbing in the local Minang community by, reportedly, Javans.  \n\nThe tensions between the Minang and the Javanese had reached a boiling point, and anti-Javanese sentiments have continued to soar, mostly in Sumatra and Sulawesi."
INS_civilwar.3.a:0 "Whatever happened to unity?"

INS_civilwar.4.t:0 "Masyumi and Murba Sighted in Sumatra"
INS_civilwar.4.d:0 "Ever since the Murba and Masyumi had been disbanded, their key figures have either joined the government like Adam Malik of Murba, clapped in irons like HAMKA of Masyumi, or seemingly vanish into the wind. \n\nBut earlier today, we received reports that major figures of the Masyumi, like Dato Muda Assaat and Sjafruddin Prawiranegara has been sighted fleeing towards Bukittinggi, bringing their families alongside them. Just as worryingly, a lot of vanished Murbaist figures like Chaerul Saleh were sighted in Bengkulu, seemingly heading north towards Padang. \n\nEither way, if Murba and Masyumi decide to prepare an uprising, we definitely know where they would start."
INS_civilwar.4.a:0 "Should've seen that coming."

INS_civilwar.5.t:0 "The Four Councils Petition"
INS_civilwar.5.d:0 "We have received a red dossier earlier today, containing a letter, filled with the names of four colonels, each a leader of a council. \n\nThe letter started with greeting and praises to both Soekarno and the country, and prayer to hope that the country would last a thousand years, another thousand years, and thousands of years more. \n\nThen the contents of the letters suddenly became serious and formal, filled with demands. The Colonels of the Dewan Gajah, Banteng, Manguni dan Rangkong demand the resignation of the Leimena cabinet, the restoration of the Parliament, an amendment to the constitution regarding regional autonomies, and finally, the formation of a cabinet without PKI influence that would rule until a general election is held. \n\nThe letter ends with a threat, that if these demands aren’t fulfilled within the next five days, the councils will take “drastic measures to save the country”."
INS_civilwar.5.a:0 "How dare they?!"

INS_civilwar.6.t:0 "The Emergency Government of Insulindia"
INS_civilwar.6.d:0 "With their demands refused, the four councils have taken their move. Ahmad Hussein had just invited former economic minister, Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, to lead an “emergency government” to save the Republic of Insulindia. He then cut off any ties to the central government of Jakarta and declared for this emergency government.  \n\nIn a short ceremony in Padang, the emergency government and the new cabinet was sworn in, with Sjafruddin as President,  Ahmad Hussein as commander-in-chief, and Maludin Simbolon as Foreign Minister. A short prayer followed the ceremony, which was then finished with a speech by Sjafruddin, proclaiming themselves as “protectors of democracy” and importantly, declaring themselves not as separatists. \n\nBut it was clear that separatists or not, this rival government is a serious challenge to national stability, and that no matter what the goals are, this is a rebellion. "
INS_civilwar.6.a:0 "Order! We will have order!"
INS_civilwar.6.b:0 "No, I call it aggressive negotiations. (Play as the PDRI)"

INS_civilwar.7.t:0 "Revolt of the Colonels"
INS_civilwar.7.d:0 "As the PDRI was declared in Padang, the colonels in Sulawesi have decided to move two days ago. \n\nThe Dewan Manguni of Joop Warouw and the Dewan Rangkong of Andi Petta Rani decided to mobilise and cut off any ties with the Central Government. They would declare for the PDRI. \n\nJust yesterday, Warouw and Andi met in Palopo in a conference to cement the alliance of the two councils, also attended many important figures, such as Wolter Monginsidi, Andi Mappanyukki, Andi Djemma, D. J. Somba and most importantly, Ventje Sumual.  \n\nAs the conference progressed, Sumual and Somba came forth with a proposal, to unite the Dewan Manguni and Rangkong in a struggle, the Universal People’s struggle, the Perjuangan Rakyat Semesta, the PERMESTA."
INS_civilwar.7.a:0 "A starving dog bites hard."
INS_civilwar.7.b:0 "Hidup Somba-Sumual! (Play as the PDRI)."

INS_civilwar.8.t:0 "Army-PKI Contention"
INS_civilwar.8.d:0 "A report reached our desk explaining about a conference between the PKI and the Army. Aidit has launched a proposal about the creation of the “fifth column”, another column of the armed forces filled with farmer-militias, to supplement the other columns, the Army, Navy, Airforce and the Police. \n\nSoedirman shot down the proposal harshly, calling it, dangerous, irresponsible, and potentially subversive to national stability. His argument was supplanted by other generals, such as A.H. Nasution, Gatot Soebroto and Achmad Yani. The PKI reeled, swallowed their pride and left the conference humiliated.  \n\nThis is merely just another episode of the clashes between the Army and PKI that had been going for weeks, even months by now, and it’s just a public secret that both have been contending for Soekarno’s favour since a long time ago, and wouldn’t stop anytime soon."
INS_civilwar.8.a:0 "Could they please get along?"

INS_civilwar.9.t:0 "Rumours of a Dewan Jendral?"
INS_civilwar.9.d:0 "An intelligence agent had just approached Soekarno, giving him a document with contents “that he might find disturbing”.  \n\nThe document details of a plot within the Army, no, all of the Military itself to launch a coup and replace Soekarno and his government with a military junta, and a cabinet filled with high ranking generals and admirals. Most notably, Soedirman as President and Commander-in-Chief, Soebroto as Vice-President and Army Chief, Nasution as Prime Minister, Yani as Foreign Minister, and Martadinata as Interior Minister. \n\nThe document looks rather unbelievable, and there are big names noted to be absent, such as General Soeharto, or even the entire Airforce. Perhaps the document was fake?"
INS_civilwar.9.a:0 "We don't have time for such hearsay!"

INS_civilwar.10.t:0 "Coup Attempt!"
INS_civilwar.10.d:0 "With the country quickly descending into chaos, and the intensified conflict far from Java, the capital is empty, with a scant few garrisons. A small army would be able to capture it and take over the National Government. \n\nAt early morning, The PKI, led by Aidit and backed by a battalion of the Presidential Guard, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Untung ibn Sjamsuri, launched a coup attempt. They kidnapped Generals Soedirman, Achmad Yani and Isaac Pandjaitan, who are still missing now, General Nasution escaped his kidnappers by hiding in Leimena’s house, and General Soebroto was not kidnapped, as he was at General Soeharto’s house during the attempt. \n\nAt the morning, Soeharto and Soebroto immediately mobilized the garrison, who would later meet Untung’s battalion in a clash in the capital’s streets. For now, it is unclear who would win, but it would seem that..."
INS_civilwar.10.a:0 "This is the final insult."
INS_civilwar.10.b:0 "The revolution has evolved!"

INS_civilwar.11.t:0 "Soeharto offers his services"
INS_civilwar.11.d:0 "After a stunning success in stomping down the rebels, Soeharto met Soekarno in the Istana Merdeka. With General Gatot Soebroto’s recommendation, Soeharto offers Soekarno his services. He offered to lead an emergency government, overruling Leimena’s current government for a while until peace is restored in the Country. \n\nSoekarno greatly admired Soeharto’s success, for Soeharto had risen from a poor, fatherless peasant into an important general sitting in front of him. A true symbol of from zero to hero, part of Soekarno’s socialist dream. As the Communists have betrayed him, Soeharto seems to be a man he can trust. Thus, Soekarno accepted Soeharto’s offer."
INS_civilwar.11.a:0 "God grant him strength."

INS_civilwar.12.t:0 "The Presidential Order"
INS_civilwar.12.d:0 "As Soekarno accepted Soeharto’s proposal, many generals, mostly from Soeharto’s own clique, are emboldened to dare ask Soekarno to sign a presidential decree to give Soeharto “dictatorial powers”, just like the dictators of ancient Rome. \n\nThey cited that Insulindia is in a time of heavy trouble, just like in the days of Lucius Cincinnatus, and as has the senate gave Cincinnatus dictatorial powers to save the Roman Republic, Soeharto should also be given dictatorial powers to save the Federal Republic of Insulindia. He should be given the power to do whatever he deems right to save the country. \n\nAfter some negotiations, three cups of coffee, and a small pistol, Soekarno decides to relent, and sign a presidential order to give “emergency powers” to Soeharto that would last indefinitely."
INS_civilwar.12.a:0 "This better be the right move.."

INS_civilwar.13.t:0 "Operation Trisula"
INS_civilwar.13.d:0 "With the government secure, Soeharto has finally decided to embark on a campaign to get rid of the PKI and their sympathizers. Today, he marked an order to “remove” any elements of the PKI and their sympathizers from society itself, whether he or she be poor, rich or somewhere in between. \n\nHe also ordered a manhunt on the key figures of the earlier coup attempt who had fled to the Javanese countryside. Figures such as Aidit, Njoto, and Untung who had vanished from the capital after Soeharto’s crackdown on them. On a happier note, Soeharto also released many political figures imprisoned by Soekarno and rehabilitated them, like HAMKA of Masyumi or Prijono of Murba."
INS_civilwar.13.a:0 "Crush the Reds!"

INS_civilwar.14.t:0 "Capture of Lieutenant-Colonel Untung"
INS_civilwar.14.d:0 "Lieutenant-Colonel Untung ibn Sjamsuri was the commander of the battalion of the Presidential Guard that participated in the PKI’s coup attempt. After his battalion was defeated, Untung fled Jakarta into the jungles of Blitar, where he laid low and hid, or at least, tried to. \n\nAtAfter a little boy who often played into the local woods returned pale frightened, telling stories of how he heard a band of jinns whispering and telling him to leave, the local kyai and locals decided to investigate and found not jinns, but Untung and a few compatriots. They were promptly pelted and brought to the authorities. \n\nAtThe capture of Untung marks the end of Trisula, as he was the last coup leader to be arrested. Untung will be brought to Jakarta where he would be tried in the Extraordinary-Court Martial or Mahkamah Militer Agung, along with his lieutenants and military accomplices."
INS_civilwar.14.a:0 "Not so lucky, eh?"

INS_civilwar.15.t:0 "Fall of Soekarno"
INS_civilwar.15.d:0 "The mobs demanded the trial of Soekarno at the Mahmilub. It was the final nail in the coffin for Soekarno’s power. It was clear that Soekarno was losing the support of the same people he liberated long ago. The same people that chanted “NASAKOM Bersatu!” has now chanted “Down with Soekarno!” \n\nAs Soekarno slowly falls from power, Soeharto climbs the ranks. For some, it would be obvious that the General will replace the Great Leader of the Revolution as the President of the Republic of Insulindia. \n\nSoekarno decided to resign in front of the court today, [GetDateText]. In the same ceremony, Soeharto was to be sworn in as President. As if it was some cruel joke, it was Soekarno who had to read the oath before Soeharto followed. After an emotional oath, General Soeharto was finally sworn in as president. God grant him strength in ruling our mighty country."
INS_civilwar.15.a:0 "Jenderalku, Jenderal Soeharto!"
