FRA_support_pekkas_desc:0 "We can help the recent uprising in Finland against the Russians through the so-called "Liberty Corridor" — a naval path to the territories of the Finnish Secret Army. Though it ofters us good possibilities, it can also be closed at any moment if the Russians see our ships, rendering our help useless."

### Events ###
fra.1.t:0 "Action of May"
fra.1.d:0 "Anton was two blocks out when he began to hear the screams.\n\nShouts of \"Vive la révolution!\" and \"L'Internationale Sera le genre humain!\" cried out, vibrating  through the air like a shimmering energy. Though he was often stoic, such an attitude would be impossible today. Anton's  heart swelled, and a grin bridged his ears. It was an expression of unrepentant joy and love for his country.As Anton approached the Parisian crowd that had gathered to watch the parading tanks, he spotted Mallory's wild hair and ragged overalls from behind. She stood next to Darcy, a tall Algerian friend and rival suitor. A flash of jealousy crossed Anton's face, before it was swiftly suppressed. Soon he found himself behind the pair, and an arm slung over each shoulder.\n\n"Comrades! What a day for a parade eh?" he spoke in his most charmingly silly accent. Mallory laughed, and Darcy enveloped his comrade in a seemingly genuine hug. The trio spent the day observing the theatrics, laughing as jets flew overhead and officers waved to the crowd. Finally, as noon approached, Mallory pointed to something with concern.\n\n"What the fuck's their problem?" she exclaimed, highlighting a string of Tanks that had begun to peel off the main road towards the crowd. Anton looked on with disbelief as the tanks pushed through the masses like a paddle through water. It took a moment for the realization to dawn, and Darcy shouted what they all were thinking \"The BGT's that way!\"Despite a few bottles and rocks thrown, the crowd remained mostly bewildered.\n\nAnton and his friends made their way to his Uncle's residence, where they might secure a radio. However they only heard noise. Soon, soldiers count being seen lingering about the streets. Anton's concern turned to anger. Whatever was going on, it had to be stopped."
fra.1.a:0 "Paris...Paris...Do you read"
fra.2.t:0 "Committee of French Revolutionaries"
fra.2.d:0 "Pierre sat before a set of television cameras and microphones, clutching a written statement and preparing to record. Like a festering wound, the sentiments that had led him to this moment had been steadily building for a decade. In those days governing the occupation zone, the words had held a life of their own, tumbling out of him onto trusted comrades. Now, it seemed wrong to cage them behind a prepared statement. Was he to be simply another politician? No. He pushed the papers aside, and hand signaled the men behind the cameras.\"Comrades, I am General Pierre Brossolette, and all my life I have had a certain idea of France\"\n\nAs Pierre spoke, his tempo continued to rise. He explained the corruption of the republic, the career bureaucrats that believed themselves above the common people, and the backroom dealings that would squander a once proud history. He spoke at length of his time in Germany, his witnessing of mistreatment towards soldiers and the growing power of the Bureau. The Bureau who would seek only to perpetuate themselves, and commit hypocritical atrocities across the world.He explained, in fiery eloquence, his vision for a new France, and their demands. Finally, when all was said and done, he took a deep breath, and began listing names. Pierre shifted in his seat, and stared deeply into the camera's center.\n\n"We accept responsibility for our actions, and remain dedicated only to France and her people. Thank you.\""
fra.2.a:0 "A counter-revolution undeniablely"
fra.2.b:0 "We could still solve this peacefullly"
fra.3.t:0 "To the Barricades!"
fra.3.d:0 "\"The unthinkable has occurred. A cabal of thugs have seized the people's government in an illegal attempt to force their counter-revolutionary philosophies upon us. A day of celebration has become a struggle for the revolution itself! The old oppressor still lurks across the dniper, waiting for a sign of weakness, surely content with Brosolette and his conspirators.We must use the oldest weapon in our arsenal. Strike! Shut down this pretender government until it can be returned to the hands of the people. Save the republic!\"\n\nThese words, and others like them are being spread rapidly across the French countryside. Agitated by various publications and now displaced government officials, it seems a massive general strike may be brewing. The demands of the Brossolette putsch may remain unfulfilled, as it seems likely its days are numbered should the people reject its mandate."
fra.3.a:0 "Quand Paris se met en colère"
franews.2.t:0 "Action of May"
franews.2.d:0 "In the annals of history, there are some events so unforeseeable that they appear divine. So it is that Paris, birthplace of the revolution and heart of the Socialist bloc, has been brought to its knees during today's may day celebrations!\n\nWhile information coming out of the city has been contradicting and scarce, what we do know paints a startling picture. Pierre Brosolette, recently returned governor-general of the German occupation zone, is reportedly responsible. The full list of his compatriots remains unknown, but other reports have claimed involvement of Henri Frenay in cutting communications outside the city, and De la Vierge in besieging naval command.Garrisons across the city have been captured or held at bay, and those few government officials that were outside have begun organising to retake it. \n\nThe Russian State embassy has wasted no time commenting on the matter, warning all Russian nationals within its premises highlighting the event as evidence of the "Frailty of the socialist system.\nNo doubt the motivations of the conspirators will soon reveal themselves, but for now, the world stands  shocked at such unprecedented events occurring within a major nuclear superpower."
