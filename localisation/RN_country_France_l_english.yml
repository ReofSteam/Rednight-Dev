fra.1.t:0 "Action of May"
fra.1.d:0 "Anton was two blocks out when he began to hear the screams.\n\nShouts of \"Vive la révolution!\" and \"L'Internationale Sera le genre humain!\" cried out, vibrating  through the air like a shimmering energy. Though he was often stoic, such an attitude would be impossible today. Anton's  heart swelled, and a grin bridged his ears. It was an expression of unrepentant joy and love for his country.As Anton approached the Parisian crowd that had gathered to watch the parading tanks, he spotted Mallory's wild hair and ragged overalls from behind. She stood next to Darcy, a tall AlFRAian friend and rival suitor. A flash of jealousy crossed Anton's face, before it was swiftly suppressed. Soon he found himself behind the pair, and an arm slung over each shoulder.\n\n"Comrades! What a day for a parade eh?" he spoke in his most charmingly silly accent. Mallory laughed, and Darcy enveloped his comrade in a seemingly genuine hug. The trio spent the day observing the theatrics, laughing as jets flew overhead and officers waved to the crowd. Finally, as noon approached, Mallory pointed to something with concern.\n\n"What the fuck's their problem?" she exclaimed, highlighting a string of Tanks that had begun to peel off the main road towards the crowd. Anton looked on with disbelief as the tanks pushed through the masses like a paddle through water. It took a moment for the realization to dawn, and Darcy shouted what they all were thinking \"The BGT's that way!\"Despite a few bottles and rocks thrown, the crowd remained mostly bewildered.\n\nAnton and his friends made their way to his Uncle's residence, where they might secure a radio. However they only heard noise. Soon, soldiers count being seen linFRAing about the streets. Anton's concern turned to anFRA. Whatever was going on, it had to be stopped."

fra.2.t:0 "Committee of French Revolutionaries"
fra.2.d:0 "Pierre sat before a set of television cameras and microphones, clutching a written statement and preparing to record. Like a festering wound, the sentiments that had led him to this moment had been steadily building for a decade. In those days governing the occupation zone, the words had held a life of their own, tumbling out of him onto trusted comrades. Now, it seemed wrong to cage them behind a prepared statement. Was he to be simply another politician? No. He pushed the papers aside, and hand signaled the men behind the cameras.\"Comrades, I am General Pierre Brossolette, and all my life I have had a certain idea of France\"\n\nAs Pierre spoke, his tempo continued to rise. He explained the corruption of the republic, the career bureaucrats that believed themselves above the common people, and the backroom dealings that would squander a once proud history. He spoke at length of his time in FRAmany, his witnessing of mistreatment towards soldiers and the growing power of the Bureau. The Bureau who would seek only to perpetuate themselves, and commit hypocritical atrocities across the world.He explained, in fiery eloquence, his vision for a new France, and their demands. Finally, when all was said and done, he took a deep breath, and began listing names. Pierre shifted in his seat, and stared deeply into the camera's center.\n\n"We accept responsibility for our actions, and remain dedicated only to France and her people. Thank you.\""

fra.3.d:0 "\"The unthinkable has occurred. A cabal of thugs have seized the people's government in an illegal attempt to force their counter-revolutionary philosophies upon us. A day of celebration has become a struggle for the revolution itself! The old oppressor still lurks across the dniper, waiting for a sign of weakness, surely content with Brosolette and his conspirators.We must use the oldest weapon in our arsenal. Strike! Shut down this pretender government until it can be returned to the hands of the people. Save the republic!\"\n\nThese words, and others like them are being spread rapidly across the French countryside. Agitated by various publications and now displaced government officials, it seems a massive general strike may be brewing. The demands of the Brossolette putsch may remain unfulfilled, as it seems likely its days are numbered should the people reject its mandate."

franews.2.t:0 "Action of May"
franews.2.d:0 "In the annals of history, there are some events so unforeseeable that they appear divine. So it is that Paris, birthplace of the revolution and heart of the Socialist bloc, has been brought to its knees during today's may day celebrations!\n\nWhile information coming out of the city has been contradicting and scarce, what we do know paints a startling picture. Pierre Brosolette, recently returned governor-general of the FRAman occupation zone, is reportedly responsible. The full list of his compatriots remains unknown, but other reports have claimed involvement of Henri Frenay in cutting communications outside the city, and De la Vierge in besieging naval command.Garrisons across the city have been captured or held at bay, and those few government officials that were outside have begun organising to retake it. \n\nThe Russian State embassy has wasted no time commenting on the matter, warning all Russian nationals within its premises highlighting the event as evidence of the "Frailty of the socialist system.\nNo doubt the motivations of the conspirators will soon reveal themselves, but for now, the world stands  shocked at such unprecedented events occurring within a major nuclear superpower."

putsch.4.t:0 "Marine-Parachutists Surrendered"
putsch.4.d:0 "Andre clutched his rifle, swung as if propelled by spring towards the window and fired indiscriminately. A hail of bullets stormed down on the invader below; a last act of annoyed defiance.\n\nThe fighting had been short and brutal. The Police prefecture, unprepared for a sudden armoured assault, was missing entire chunks of its foundation. Radio operators lay dead or dying on the floor, as the Gaurde Nationale charged inside; ants in feast.\n\nEach ricochet into the office trigFRAed another set of rounds in return. It had become something akin to a game. Andre would hunker behind the desk, nursing the red oozing from his shoulder. A stray would fly overhead, sending chunks of wood from the cabinet across the desk and into his lap. Then an angry shout would erupt from his lips, two adrenaline filled legs would shoot up, and another clip would empty.\n\nEventually, down to his last bullet, he grunted, threw the rifle aside, and screamed with the last of his energy.\n\n"Come and see you traitorous shits!"\n\nA silence gripped the room for a moment as his opponents awaited another barrage. He chuckled a bit, happy he had instilled some fear in the bastards who served those bureaucrats. Finally satisfied they would encounter no further resistance, the stormtroopers sprinted into the room. Andre opened his eyes slowly, gazing up at the six barrels pointed towards his general direction.\n\nHe donned a smile and raised his hands. As far as life went, he had to say, it had been a pretty exciting one."
putsch.4.a:0 "Vive la France!"
putsch.9.t:0 "Marine-Parachutists Pacified"
putsch.9.d:0 "As the moon gave way to its brilliant orange stalker, the still air found itself under siege. Small at first, a chant grew in its fury, a low hum made deafening.\n\nA thousand voices stormed the cobblestone bridge; the route to the police prefecture.Their stampeding feet awoke all who slumbered inside, and if one were to keep a keen ear, then it could be heard that they were singing.\n\nDespite their size, they moved with purpose and tact. As seen from an eagle's eye, it was a thing of great beauty. A once formless mass, spouting wings and moving swiftly as it crossed the bridge, its left and right flank led by separate bearers of the red flag.\n\nThe center soon collided, overwhelming the scared and confused soldiers manning the front gates. Through numbers and song, they halted any chance of a fired bullet. Some could even be seen hugging those in uniform, gripping them tightly in both fraternity and anFRA.\n\nOn the flanks, ladders soon unfolded. Determined spiders, climbing past windows and balconies, entered on all sides.\n\nThrough it all, Andre smiled and drank. Taking in the sounds and sights as they descended upon him. Never before had he seen such an action of such grace and swiftness from the people. Regardless of whether the bastards from Paris had orchestrated it, he would not fire on civilians. They had gambled, and though he wished to bluff a strong hand, he had no choice but to fold. Thus, Andre's short reign came to an end, undone peacefully, and punctuated by whispered radio apologies to Pierre. All across the 4th arrondissement that day, there would be those that stopped to ask..."

fra.5.t:0 "A Farewell to Arms"
fra.5.d:0 "He would not be citizen Louis Capet.\n\nSo it was that when  the mob of dusty workers, steel eyed veterans, shoe toting grandmothers, and passionate students began to assault the doors of the BGT building, Pierre approached the balcony with a megaphone. He looked out at the sheer size of the massive crowd, wishing they could only see in their government what he did.\n\n"Comrades" he began, before adjusting the volume of the megaphone "My Comrades!"\n\nThose closest to the building stopped their assault momentarily, and glanced up at the general.\n\n"I have undertaken this task in the name of the masses. However, It has now become clear to me that I do not possess their blessing."Pierre stared at the floor before continuing\n\n"French, French you honourable people.  My life I have dedicated to you. But, if it is the will of the citizens of Paris that my mandate be rejected, I have no choice but to obey.  I ask only that you march forward fearlessly toward destiny, united and proud as you have demonstrated today. Lets us sing the Marseilese - the most beautiful song, as for myself, i have no voice left"\n\nEven the distant crowd had quieted now, a phenomenon few other men could create. All eyes were upon Pierre. He smiled slightly, and began his ascent downstairs and into custody."
fra.5.a:0 "Goodbye, Pierre"
fra.5.d.b:0 "It was finally over.\n\nEdouard let the shotgun fall against his knee, staring at the towering presence before him. Though only moments before adrenaline had surged through his muscles like a knife, now he simply stood motionless. Unsure of how to proceed.\n\nThe general too was unmoving, as was everyone in the room. It mattered not how much carnage littered the floors below, for there was nothing but respect in the air now. Edouard himself was supposed to do the handcuffing, yet once  he had reached his target, the process seemed unfathomable. How could you arrest a living legend?\n\n"Comrades." Pierre stated simply, finally breaking the long silence "No need to make things messier"\n\nThus with a curt salute, and the adjustment of his hat, Pierre followed the men in tow, peacefully submitting to defeat. As the unit passed other soldiers throughout the building, they were greeted with only quiet nods, an absence of hatred towards their so-called "enemy". As they made their way to the door, Pierre finally stopped, staring at a series of crumpled bodies on the ground. It was here Edouard gazed upon the image he would never forget; the sad eyes of France's most controversial figure.\n\nFinally, the detour over, he stepped out into the light. As the armoured van grew closer, the general's stoic expression turned to a slight grin, and a voice bellowed from his lips.\The man who had just tried to overthrow the government was now proudly singing the La Marseillaise.\n\nThe Republic had survived, despite the calamity that had gripped the city. Yet, though he could not put his finFRA on it, something felt different. A sweeter air, a bluer sky. Pierre had lost, yes, but Edouard had a feeling his legacy would endure, somewhere far outside the walls of a prison cell..."

africa.0.d:0 "It was quite a spacious room, for such a small and mundane building. Like most potential meeting places in Oran, it sat above commotion below. The people in the streets rushed to and fro; pinballs in a great machine. Inside the room, two Frenchmen stood opposed across a grand table. By the first man's side were two native representatives, by the second's side was only the clock on the wall. It had been chilly for springtime, yet the discussion to come would be sure to make men sweat.\n\nAt the table's center sat four distinct flags; sets of twins. Two tricolors reflected their representatives as did the banners of the infant north african republics. It had been four years since the "final crusade" by the grand army of the continent. Frenchmen had descended upon their former colonies, intent to liberate everything from Tunis to Casa Blanca and dislodge the final fortress of the old order. It was in this same room in 1947 that the slog ended by armistice. The revolutionary army returned home in light of european matters. The exiles breathed a sigh of relief, and though they were forgotten they never faded away./n/nToday Paris remembers, and with remembrance comes an ultimatum, they face a miserable representative of desperate French and FRAman colonists. The exiles, who occupy positions all throughout the breadth of the Sahara, are out of time. The enemy has returned. If they can just delay the inevitable assault however, they might be able to regroup their forces. all while life goes on just meters below."

We will no lonFRA tolerate such flagrant abuse of the 1947 treaty...”\n\nThe meeting would go on for a while. The bastard colon did all he could to divert and delay. He spoke of “compromise” and “unnecessary bloodshed” but Youcef knew the truth. It was a ploy, buying time for reinforcements to mobilize.

It was an unpleasant sight, one that dredged up too many memories.\n\n"Fuck" he murmured to himself as one of the bastards took the empty seat next to him. The boy shoved his rucksack beneath his legs, buckled the seatbelt eaFRAly and was quiet for a moment.

"Free Africa?". Nothing is ever free. You pay. One way or another"\n\nHe looked the boy in the eyes, more sympathetic now.\n\n"War is never something to be celebrated, you hear me?

He had to give them credit, the bastards knew how to fight a guerilla war. Regardless, now it was nothing but ruins.\n\nHenri turned to glance behind; around fifteen men draped in white, the other two in prim uniforms. In his opinion, the representatives of the famed “bureau” looked quite silly compared to the natives. The nomads fit the setting, but his comrades had been plopped from another reality. At least the tribesmen had the good sense to protect their skin. He wondered which tribe they were from, and hoped the authorities would not treat them too harshly even if they had been paid to raise arms against the fraternal love of the social republic. Caravans were no match for modern weaponry.\n\nHenri looked at his shoe and found a few scattered drops of blood upon it. He swished it back and forth in the sand. The sand that seemed to stretch forever in all directions.

To have such a profession, one required a coping mechanism of some kind. Though sometimes he thought calling it a profession might be inaccurate. "Burden" held what seemed the correct syllables, as did "Responsibility". His superiors preferred the word "Duty".\n\nToday was a usual day. The two Brunos sat at their station, one cognizant and the other forced deep into subconscious recesses. They reviewed the launch protocols with Cecilia as was required, then discussed the procedure they had already discussed hundreds of times. Both him and Cecilia understood the purpose of such minutiae and as such took it seriously. The buried Bruno was regularly annoyed at its occurrence, though he would not be allowed to surface to voice such concerns. Ultimately, that was his purpose; a dumping ground for such thoughts. In addition, Comrade Cecilia would have to report it, and he would likewise report her for expressing such sentiments.\n\nWhen the formalities were dispensed with, the two could finally settle in for the day. They sat at their terminals, listening for any radio broadcasts and repeatedly checking in with high command. It was in these moments that the other Bruno surfaced in daydreams.Yesterday he had been a simple farmer toiling away south of here, in Marseille. Today he was a commando on the Belgian Front, serving alongside his brave comrades against the Russian Beast.\n\nSuddenly, the radio squawked to life. Daydreams ceased immediately as the stern faced Bruno resumed control. Cecilia was faster though and picked up the bright red telephone. Her voice did not waver, though her expression notably darkened. A pit began to form in his stomach."

In a few moments there would be no point in reporting anybody to anything. \n\nThere was still the possibility of it being a drill of course, yet she doubted it. When the drills came they did so months apart, and considering the situation outside an actual launch was far from implausible. Fuck.

The Radio began squawking.\n\n"22A79B" it said. There was a short pause before it spoke again. Then another code "22A9FF."\n\nHer shaky finger traced the digits and she recited each one under her breath to steady herself. In the middle of the page she would find the second code. Bruno found the first a moment later. It was not a drill. He grabbed the telephone."
