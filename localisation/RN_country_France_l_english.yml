Though it ofters us good possibilities, it can also be closed at any moment if the Russians see our ships, rendering our help useless."

### Events ###
fra.1.t:0 "Action of May"
fra.1.d:0 "Anton was two blocks out when he began to hear the screams.\n\nShouts of \"Vive la révolution!\" and \"L'Internationale Sera le genre humain!\" cried out, vibrating  through the air like a shimmering energy. Though he was often stoic, such an attitude would be impossible today. Anton's  heart swelled, and a grin bridged his ears. It was an expression of unrepentant joy and love for his country.As Anton approached the Parisian crowd that had gathered to watch the parading tanks, he spotted Mallory's wild hair and ragged overalls from behind. She stood next to Darcy, a tall Algerian friend and rival suitor. A flash of jealousy crossed Anton's face, before it was swiftly suppressed. Soon he found himself behind the pair, and an arm slung over each shoulder.\n\n"Comrades! What a day for a parade eh?" he spoke in his most charmingly silly accent. Mallory laughed, and Darcy enveloped his comrade in a seemingly genuine hug. The trio spent the day observing the theatrics, laughing as jets flew overhead and officers waved to the crowd. Finally, as noon approached, Mallory pointed to something with concern.\n\n"What the fuck's their problem?" she exclaimed, highlighting a string of Tanks that had begun to peel off the main road towards the crowd. Anton looked on with disbelief as the tanks pushed through the masses like a paddle through water. It took a moment for the realization to dawn, and Darcy shouted what they all were thinking \"The BGT's that way!\"Despite a few bottles and rocks thrown, the crowd remained mostly bewildered.\n\nAnton and his friends made their way to his Uncle's residence, where they might secure a radio. However they only heard noise. Soon, soldiers count being seen lingering about the streets. Anton's concern turned to anger. Whatever was going on, it had to be stopped."
fra.1.a:0 "Paris...Paris...Do you read"
fra.2.t:0 "Committee of French Revolutionaries"
fra.2.d:0 "Pierre sat before a set of television cameras and microphones, clutching a written statement and preparing to record. Like a festering wound, the sentiments that had led him to this moment had been steadily building for a decade. In those days governing the occupation zone, the words had held a life of their own, tumbling out of him onto trusted comrades. Now, it seemed wrong to cage them behind a prepared statement. Was he to be simply another politician? No. He pushed the papers aside, and hand signaled the men behind the cameras.\"Comrades, I am General Pierre Brossolette, and all my life I have had a certain idea of France\"\n\nAs Pierre spoke, his tempo continued to rise. He explained the corruption of the republic, the career bureaucrats that believed themselves above the common people, and the backroom dealings that would squander a once proud history. He spoke at length of his time in Germany, his witnessing of mistreatment towards soldiers and the growing power of the Bureau. The Bureau who would seek only to perpetuate themselves, and commit hypocritical atrocities across the world.He explained, in fiery eloquence, his vision for a new France, and their demands. Finally, when all was said and done, he took a deep breath, and began listing names. Pierre shifted in his seat, and stared deeply into the camera's center.\n\n"We accept responsibility for our actions, and remain dedicated only to France and her people. Thank you.\""
fra.2.a:0 "A counter-revolution undeniablely"
fra.2.b:0 "We could still solve this peacefullly"
fra.3.t:0 "To the Barricades!"
fra.3.d:0 "\"The unthinkable has occurred. A cabal of thugs have seized the people's government in an illegal attempt to force their counter-revolutionary philosophies upon us. A day of celebration has become a struggle for the revolution itself! The old oppressor still lurks across the dniper, waiting for a sign of weakness, surely content with Brosolette and his conspirators.We must use the oldest weapon in our arsenal. Strike! Shut down this pretender government until it can be returned to the hands of the people. Save the republic!\"\n\nThese words, and others like them are being spread rapidly across the French countryside. Agitated by various publications and now displaced government officials, it seems a massive general strike may be brewing. The demands of the Brossolette putsch may remain unfulfilled, as it seems likely its days are numbered should the people reject its mandate."
fra.3.a:0 "Quand Paris se met en colère"
franews.2.t:0 "Action of May"
franews.2.d:0 "In the annals of history, there are some events so unforeseeable that they appear divine. So it is that Paris, birthplace of the revolution and heart of the Socialist bloc, has been brought to its knees during today's may day celebrations!\n\nWhile information coming out of the city has been contradicting and scarce, what we do know paints a startling picture. Pierre Brosolette, recently returned governor-general of the German occupation zone, is reportedly responsible. The full list of his compatriots remains unknown, but other reports have claimed involvement of Henri Frenay in cutting communications outside the city, and De la Vierge in besieging naval command.Garrisons across the city have been captured or held at bay, and those few government officials that were outside have begun organising to retake it. \n\nThe Russian State embassy has wasted no time commenting on the matter, warning all Russian nationals within its premises highlighting the event as evidence of the "Frailty of the socialist system.\nNo doubt the motivations of the conspirators will soon reveal themselves, but for now, the world stands  shocked at such unprecedented events occurring within a major nuclear superpower."

putsch.1.t:0 "Subduing The Admiral"
putsch.1.d:0 "Though a series of military operations launched on Cherbourg, we have subdued the rebellous Admiral.\n\nHis fate will be announced later.\n\nVive la France."

putsch.6.t:0 "Talking The Admiral Out"
putsch.6.d:0 "Though it was not thought to not be possible, we've managed to talk the Admiral out of the situation.\n\nFor now, his activity is stopped.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.6.a:0 "Good."

putsch.2.t:0 "Crushing The Paratroopers"
putsch.2.d:0 "Our brave soldiers have put down their traitorous rebellion to an end.\n\nAll participants will be put on trial.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.2.a:0 "Make them fear."
putsch.7.t:0 "Paratroopers Surrender!"
putsch.7.d:0 "The 2nd Paratrooper Division has agreed to surrender after we have announced our intentions.\n\nThey might help in our future operations.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.7.a:0 "Nice."

putsch.3.t:0 "No More CAAB"
putsch.3.d:0 "Our valiant heroes have broken into their cabinets and put an end to this treason.\n\nCitizen Association Against Bureaucracy is now dismantled and their activities are declared illegal.\n\nVive la France."

putsch.8.t:0 "CAAB Complies"

putsch.4.t:0 "Marines Stopped"
putsch.4.d:0 "The 3rd Marine Infantry Parachute Division is dismantled after fierce battles after which we have emerged victorious.\n\nTheir leader has escaped being shot on the spot, though his ill fate is sealed.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.4.a:0 "France is not a bucket of crayons."
putsch.9.t:0 "Marines Pacified"
putsch.9.d:0 "Some good promises to the Division were made, and we've managed to disarm them.\n\nIn reward, their sentences will be shortened.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.9.a:0 "The war board has gained some more crayons."

putsch.5.t:0 "Alsace-Lorraine Brigade Destroyed!"
putsch.5.d:0 "Heavy fighting has finally struck some common sense in their minds.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine Brigade has been completely restocked with other, more loyal soldiers.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.5.a:0 "We won't give the spoils of war so easily."
putsch.10.t:0 "Alsace-Lorraine Secured Again"
putsch.10.d:0 "Amazingly, a good word about national pride and unity has changed their hearts.\n\nTheir loyalty was not only regained, but bolstered too.\n\nVive la France."
putsch.10.a:0 "Much better."

putsch.11.t:0 "The Committee Dismantled"
putsch.11.d:0 "Through our collective efforts, the traitors were put down.\n\nThe Committee is no more.\n\nViva la France."
putsch.11.a:0 "Finally."

putsch.13.t:0 "Compromise"

putsch.13.a:0 "Let's face our defeats without fear."

fra.5.t:0 "A Farewell to Arms"
fra.5.d:0 "He would not be citizen Louis Capet.\n\nSo it was that when  the mob of dusty workers, steel eyed veterans, shoe toting grandmothers, and passionate students began to assault the doors of the BGT building, Pierre approached the balcony with a megaphone. He looked out at the sheer size of the massive crowd, wishing they could only see in their government what he did.\n\n"Comrades" he began, before adjusting the volume of the megaphone "My Comrades!"\n\nThose closest to the building stopped their assault momentarily, and glanced up at the general.\n\n"I have undertaken this task in the name of the masses. However, It has now become clear to me that I do not possess their blessing."Pierre stared at the floor before continuing\n\n"French, French you honourable people.  My life I have dedicated to you. But, if it is the will of the citizens of Paris that my mandate be rejected, I have no choice but to obey.  I ask only that you march forward fearlessly toward destiny, united and proud as you have demonstrated today. Lets us sing the Marseilese - the most beautiful song, as for myself, i have no voice left"\n\nEven the distant crowd had quieted now, a phenomenon few other men could create. All eyes were upon Pierre. He smiled slightly, and began his ascent downstairs and into custody."
fra.5.a:0 "Goodbye, Pierre"
fra.5.d.b:0 "It was finally over.\n\nEdouard let the shotgun fall against his knee, staring at the towering presence before him. Though only moments before adrenaline had surged through his muscles like a knife, now he simply stood motionless. Unsure of how to proceed.\n\nThe general too was unmoving, as was everyone in the room. It mattered not how much carnage littered the floors below, for there was nothing but respect in the air now. Edouard himself was supposed to do the handcuffing, yet once  he had reached his target, the process seemed unfathomable. How could you arrest a living legend?\n\n"Comrades." Pierre stated simply, finally breaking the long silence "No need to make things messier"\n\nThus with a curt salute, and the adjustment of his hat, Pierre followed the men in tow, peacefully submitting to defeat. As the unit passed other soldiers throughout the building, they were greeted with only quiet nods, an absence of hatred towards their so-called "enemy". As they made their way to the door, Pierre finally stopped, staring at a series of crumpled bodies on the ground. It was here Edouard gazed upon the image he would never forget; the sad eyes of France's most controversial figure.\n\nFinally, the detour over, he stepped out into the light. As the armoured van grew closer, the general's stoic expression turned to a slight grin, and a voice bellowed from his lips.\The man who had just tried to overthrow the government was now proudly singing the La Marseillaise.\n\nThe Republic had survived, despite the calamity that had gripped the city. Yet, though he could not put his finger on it, something felt different. A sweeter air, a bluer sky. Pierre had lost, yes, but Edouard had a feeling his legacy would endure, somewhere far outside the walls of a prison cell..."
