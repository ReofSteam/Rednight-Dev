ire.1.t:0 "The Death of Michael Collins"
ire.1.d:0 "Last night the first Prime Minister and two-term President Michael Collins died of cancer in his home at the age of 60. Collins has had a legendary political career, and seemingly held Ireland together since its foundation in 1922, until the end of his second term as president in 1940. Collins was referred to as both “Father of the Republic” and “the Irish Napoleon,” and while they seem to be contradictory descriptions, they are both apt for the man who held such a huge role in the Irish national conscience. His belief in republican values has had a huge role in ensuring that Ireland remains one of the last liberal democracies left on the globe, while his personal magnetism and political influence paints him as a Bonapartist figure. All of Ireland mourns today for the loss of its father."

IRE_stagnant_economy_desc:0 "A lack of outside investment and the decline of the global trading economy has hit our beloved island hard, and only our unique position of trading with the International has kept the nation afloat. Emigration is still high, so something must be done if ireland is to prosper in this brave new world."
IRE_ulster_parties:0 "The Ulster Parties"
IRE_ulster_parties_desc:0 "Ever since the Ulster war of 1925 many protestants in the north have refused to recognise the sovereignty of the Irish republic over the Province of Ulster. A Significant portion of the Elected TDs of northern seats have refused to sit in the Dail as protest, and some factions openly call for terrorism against our Republic."

IRE_post_office_desc:0 "As a result of our Unique neutral position with total diplomatic recognition from both Major power blocs ireland has become the defacto place for whatever diplomacy happens between them, with their embassies in Dublin as a condiut for negotiation. We should use this opportunity as a means to protect our sovereignty and profit from the Economic opportunities this provides."
IRE_irish_church:0 "The Irish Church"
IRE_irish_church_desc:0 "Although as per the constitution, Ireland is a multifaith and secular nation, the influence of the catholic church in Ireland is undeniable. It owns and controls the majority of schools and hospitals in the country and provides a social bedrock for much of irish life as it has for centuries and as such is a bastion for conservatism and traditionalism in the country. Anyone presenting a program of social change in the country is sure to meet stiff opposition from all levels of the church."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JAMES_DILLON_DESC:0 "§YTaoiseach§!\n\nJames Dillon was not everyone's expected choice to be leader of Fine Gael and Taoiseach, yet his time as Leader of the Opposition was crucial to keeping the party together after its historic defeat in the 1937 Election and its first years in opposition. Even though the defeat was partially blamed on a reaction against President Collins rapprochement with the Mosley regime in Britain, Dillon maintained his personal and often isolated defence of Ireland's closeness to its neighbouring state. His outstanding oratory skills and fierce advocacy of agricultural protectionism earned him a political niche in the Dáil during these years.\n\nOften sidelined through the years of opposition, the looming 1948 election saw Fianna Fáil just short of a majority and a hung Dáil take effect. In order to regain its previous position, Collins instructed the party to make a deal with the socialist Labour Party and the rising, new Clann na Poblachata, who were threatening both parties with a mixture of agricultural populism and social liberalism. In the face of this odd coalition Dillon was picked out as the compromise candidate to lead Ireland's first inter-party government, a strange mix of traditional conservatives, Collins followers and socialists. So far the coalition has maintained this odd balance, but many speculate a single crisis could send it tumbling."
