GRE_KN_1950_DESC:0 "As Greece enters the 50th year of the 20th century, there has yet again sparked a debate on its future.\n\nThere are demands for the monarchs to return and a democratic threat that wants their power to come back. There are those who simply think we were weakened by the Great Levantine War and that our economy never really recovered. That we are a weak nation in a world plagued by socialism.\n\nThe truth, my fellow citizens, is that we are glorious!"

kn_greece.0.d:0 "When the Great Levantine War started, we initially saw it as nothing but a minor conflict. However, when the Russians promised our former territories back, the public wanted us to join for different reasons. Some wanted to see their family members and some just wanted to be able to sleep well knowing that there was no reason to fear the Turks and Bulgarians. We promised them that they would see their family members, but we could not promise them to be able to sleep well.\n\nAfter the war ended, we got some of the promised land. Some thought it was not enough. While we fought alongside of the Russians, we never entered an alliance with them. We just promised each other that we would not fight each other.\n\nThe pro-Russian groups, who call themselves \"Filiki Eteria\", scream about how we are a weak nation and how we should have taken more. A lot of people seemed to agree with them and even joining their militias.\n\nThe West saw this as an opportunity and funded socialists in our nation. This would not stand for Aléxandros Papagos, of our glorious army, who quickly shut them down and took control and stabilized our nation."

### Ideas ###
GRE_glorious_military:0 "Our Glorious Military"
GRE_glorious_military_desc:0 "In 1941, the Hellenic Republic came to end in an extremely popular coup d'état by the infamous Field Marshall Alexandros Papagos. During Papagos' rule, the army has received extensive funding and attention. Such a policy makes sense in light of Papagos' martial methods of rule. However, despite all this increased prominence, the Hellenic military is still widely regarded as secondary in prowess to its local rivals, due to its frequent humiliations in the last decades. Alexandros seems determined to counteract this sentiment declaring the Hellenic Military “The mightiest organized force in all the Balkans!”. Experts from both INFOR and SARPAC have called this claim doubtful, and many are confused by what exactly \"mightiest\" means specifically.\n\nStill, in the past, journalists in Greece who have dared to question the Marshall’s outlandish statements have frequently and mysteriously “gone missing”, and it is no wonder that most of the native media establishment have celebrated the government's claims. Only time will tell if these colorful statements hold any kernels of truth."
GRE_regency_council:0 "Regency Council"
GRE_regency_council_desc:0 "After the sudden death of former King Alexander I, Alexander Papagos ordered for a regency council to put in place as there had been dispute between Prince Geórgios and Prince Pávlos. The regency council is still undecided, but is expected to reach an agreement soon. Whether or not this will change the political climate of Greece is still up to be seen"
GRE_state_orthodoxy:0 "State Orthodoxy"
GRE_state_orthodoxy_desc:0 "\"Christ is in our midst! He is and ever shall be!\"\n\nOrthodox Christianity is the main religion practiced in [THIS.GetName], far ahead of the rest, and also the state religion. Because of this, the people are very united in faith, though this also means the Orthodox Church holds great sway in the politics and administration of the country. Any wise ruler would make sure not to anger them, or at least know how to supress them."
GRE_military_regime:0 "Military Regime"
GRE_military_regime_desc:0 "The regime that rules the nation is one born of despair. The 4th Republic, one once supported by the military, had proven to be useless, and something had to happen. With the failures of the government well in mind, the bold and quick action of the National Saviour, Alexandros Papagos, proved to be decisive. On the 10th of October 1941, in one fell swoop, he seized the government and set it to work on recovering Greece to its former glory, unhindered by bureaucracy and fifth columnist oposition.\n\nOr, at least, that's what the propaganda says..."
