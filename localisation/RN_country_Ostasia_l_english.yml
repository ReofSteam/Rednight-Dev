misc.1.t:0 "The Black Fleet Struck!"
misc.1.d:0 "Calamity at sea!\n\nToday a [THIS.GetAdjective] ship was reported missing following several distress calls. We managed to rescue a few survivors, all of which recounted quite a harrowing tale. They claim to have been attacked by what was first thought to be a coastal patrol. This was in fact a group of pirates, who boarded and seized the ship at gunpoint following their inconspicuous approach. Several members of the crew, though not all, were herded onto lifeboats, which our navy spotted and picked up.The status of their ship itself was confirmed many hours later, as it was found drifting empty of cargo near a small Indonesian Island.\n\n Maritime security has greatly deteriorated in the west pacific alongside the decline of global trade. This situation has gotten worse since the evacuation of the Kriegsmarine’s Ostasien station. It was also certainly affected by the chaos of the Indonesian national revolution, and  Japanese expansion in the pacific.\n\n It is unknown just where these pirates originate from. The survivors claim that they spoke a strange language reminiscent of German and English, but that it sounded mostly like gibberish.This incident is a loss to our economy and a humiliation to our national pride."
misc.1.a:0 "Damn it!"
misc.2.t:0 "Raid Failed!"
misc.2.d:0 "It has been quite a while since we sent them out, and yet  our taskforce has failed to return. Whether they were killed, captured, or sunk, we must now assume they shall not return home. Their memory must be honored, and new raids launched as soon as possible. We need more supplies if we are to survive."
misc.2.a:0 "They died for their country."
misc.3.t:0 "Pecuilar Criminals"
misc.3.d:0 "Captain Glassner didn't hate them. In fact, he wished they had met under better circumstances. There was an undeniably attractive quality about those he was conversing with. It revived a boyish fantasy evoking visions of a different life; one full of breakneck adventure.\nThen the German smacked him in the gut with the but of a rifle.\n\n"Verzeihung, Sir."\n\nHe laughed as he crumpled to the ground. Never before had a man apologized for taking him hostage. Two burly sailors gripped him by the arms, thrusting them behind his back. A single handcuff materialised on his right wrist, the other cuff to a small metal pipe behind.\n\n"You know the drill. Search the lower decks."\n\nThe hours passed and one by one the crew joined Captain Glassner. When the Pirates ran out of handcuffs, they simply took to stern commands and pointed guns. A few brave idiots rushed said guns. The muzzle flashes made quick work of those sailors.\n\nWhen it was all said and done and the ships small cargo had been carted off, Glassner could resist no longer. He called out to the one who had humbled him.\n\n"Who are you?0""
misc.3.a:0 "We're the Vitalienbrüder, Captain."

GEA_Bauers_Submariners_desc:0 "It is through sheer force of personality that Captain Bauer holds our rowdy sailors together. The fatherland may have surrendered, but we have not. As long as it is occupied we may not return. Thankfully, the Kriegsmarine is used to making do, and our leader is quite courageous. We shall scavenge, survive, and thrive despite being surrounded by enemies. We are free men, and we shall never surrender!"

POLITICS_MAX_BAUER_DESC:0 "Captain Max Bauer never thought he'd end up like this, but he has learned to enjoy it. After all, the waves of fate are fickle, and they must be ridden to their ends.\n\nA captain from the young age of twenty eight, Max climbed the ranks rapidly and was sent to serve in German East Asia. When both the colony and the Fatherland themselves collapsed, Max was left adrift. Yet he had a duty to those under his command, and he would not see them sacrificed to savage past-subjects or godless socialists. Using his ever charming personality and good natured attitude, Max led hundreds of fellow submariners to a network of  naval stations.Since the war his forces have consolidated there. Max himself resides in Palau, where he tries his best to care for his people.\n\nUngentlemanly methods must be balanced against the needs of his restless men, as well as Max's idealistic nature. He hopes the spirit of the empire may be kept alive. Yet doing so without the stars on one's uniform becoming dirtied may be an impossible task."
