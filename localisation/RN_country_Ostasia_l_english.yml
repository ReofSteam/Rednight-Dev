misc.2.d:0 "It has been quite a while since we sent them out, and yet  our taskforce has failed to return. Whether they were killed, captured, or sunk, we must now assume they shall not return home. Their memory must be honored, and new raids launched as soon as possible. We need more supplies if we are to survive."

GEA_Bauers_Submariners:0 "It is through sheer force of personality that Captain Bauer holds our rowdy sailors together. He stands tall amongst them, guiding them away from meaningless violence or ungentlemanly conduct. While the fatherland may be lost, its spirit is found in his swaggering steps and cunning strategy. For those under Bauers command, the war never ended."
GEA_critical_shortages:0 "Critical Shortages"
GEA_critical_shortages:0  "Palau is not exactly abundant in resources, especially the kind needed to keep engines running. We cannot return home, and enemies circle the waves surrounding our island refuge. It is a simple fact; we must raid or perish."
GEA_kriegsmarine_Training:0 "Kriegsmarine Training"
GEA_kriegsmarine_Training:0 "The Kriegsmarine has always been independent by necessity, having to operate in relative isolation in both the first and second world wars. While the current situation is obviously far more dire, making due with what one has is a time honored tradition amongst sailors."

POLITICS_MAX_BAUER_DESC:0 "Captain Max Bauer never thought he'd end up like this, but he has learned to enjoy it. After all, the waves of fate are fickle, and they must be ridden to their ends.\n\nA captain from the young age of twenty eight, Max climbed the ranks rapidly and was sent to serve in German East Asia. When both the colony and the Fatherland themselves collapsed, Max was left adrift. Yet he had a duty to those under his command, and he would not see them sacrificed to savage past-subjects or godless socialists. Using his ever charming personality and good natured attitude, Max led hundreds of fellow submariners to a network of  naval stations.Since the war his forces have consolidated there. Max himself resides in Palau, where he tries his best to care for his people.\n\nUngentlemanly methods must be balanced against the needs of his restless men, as well as Max's idealistic nature. He hopes the spirit of the empire may be kept alive. Yet doing so without the stars on one's uniform becoming dirtied may be an impossible task."
