AUS_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Mannlicher M.95"
AUS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."
AUS_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Mannlicher-FÉG Karabiner M.24"
AUS_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Kar M.24"
AUS_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."
AUS_infantry_equipment_2:0 "ZB Selbstladekarabiner M.42"
AUS_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "SlKar M.42"
AUS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."
AUS_infantry_equipment_3:0 "ZB Maschinenkarabiner M.44"
AUS_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "MKar M.44"
AUS_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The development of a portable automatic rifle using an intermediate cartridge was born in the Monarchy thanks to the success of the Király series of "heavy" submachine guns and the realisation that combat ranges were far shorter than anticipated. Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

This rifle, chambered in 7.65×53mm Mauser, became the backbone of the Bolivian military and demand for domestically produced rifles sparked rapid growth in the Bolivian arms industry."

BOS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

BOS_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg made the M.95's deficiencies all-too obvious, especially its relatively underpowered round-nose cartridge and the required maintenance for the straight-pull action. Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

BOS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "While the Imperial and Royal forces were interested in self-loading rifles since the late 1920s, the political and economic situation along with repeated disapointments during trials delayed the project while the Army focused on other developments. When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

The KP/-41 itself began as a derivative of Lahti's own 'Suomi' submachine gun rechambered for his new cartridge, and indeed, while retention of the general shape and feel of the KP/-31 was prefered, ultimately, the new design's massive recoil impetus led to both further external changes to the weapon's body as well as a reduction in its cyclic rate."

However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later.

The Chilean Mauser 1895 has earned a reputation for reliability under even the harshest conditions, one which it maintains decades after its adoption. It it mainly with these Chilean Mausers that the revolutionary government in Patagonia is equipped."

FOP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Shortly before the Weltkrieg, Chile contracted the Austrian arms manufacturer Steyr for a new Carbine variant of the German Mauser 1898 chambered in 7x57mm like older Chilean rifles. Many of these carbines eventually fell into the hands of the Chilean Carabinieros, who found the rifle unsatisfactory and lobbied for its replacement. In 1935, a new pattern with improved ergonomics and a new larger magazine with more robust feed lips and loader was approved and entered into production shortly thereafter. A few months after its initial production, the rifles began to trickle into Patagonia."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Wanting to maximise the firepower of the infantryman, Czech designer Alois Farlík developed the 8x45mm intermediate cartridge while ZB designed the machine-carbine around it. It would adopt it as the Maschinenkarabiner M.44."

HUN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

The standardisation of all Mausers in Ottoman inventory helped ease the logistical nightmare of having to supply 4 different types of rifle ammunition to all units. As a client state of the Ottoman Empire, Tripolitania also began to slowly adopt the M38 and standardize around the 8x57mm rifle cartidge."

The rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge both before and while the rest of the world waged the Weltkrieg."

While the new 7.8x58mm cartidge bears obvious resemblance to the .303 British round, the rifle itself looks quite unique with its 25 round magazine and equally gigantic sights."

While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

The original five round internal magazine, however, was deemed insufficient and a new variant of the MAS-40/42, the 40/42, was developed featuring a detachable ten round box magazine. A small number of MAS-40/42 rifles were smuggled into Nicaragua along with production tooling specifications."

The weapon is functionally a near copy of the German Mauser M1924, and a considerable improvement over the much older Type 88 in terms of weight and recoil.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Hanyang Arsenal with German tools, though it may not fully replace its predecessors for some time."

SLO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

The Saurer R77 artillery tractor was one of the first of such converstions and was relatively simple: An armoured \"box\" was added to the chasis that protected the driver and personnel inside. The deployment of these conversions helped cement the concept of armoured transports in Austrian doctrine."

SVK_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

TRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mannlicher M1895 (German: Infanterie Repetier-Gewehr M.95) was the service rifle of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces during the Weltkrieg. Designed by Ferdinand von Mannlicher, it used a straight-pull bolt-action for increased rate-of-fire compared to its contemporaries, giving it the nickname Ruck-Zuck (German slang for "back and forth") by Austrian troops and "Ta-Pum" by the Italians on the receiving end. The Italian song "Ta pum!" from the Weltkrieg refers to this rifle. Later in the war, most rifles were converted into the short "Stutzen" ("cut-down") configuration."

Steyr developed the 8x56mm "Spitzer" cartridge that would serve as the basis to a new generation of weapons and push the M.95 to its full potential. In the 1924 Rifle Trial, the Hungarian FÉG design based on the Mannlicher-Schönauer's excellent turn-bolt-action won out and was adopted."

When the second Weltkrieg erupted, interest in the project was renewed and Zbrojovka Brno in Bohemia would have its design adopted in 1942. The rifle was quite modern, using a gas-operated system, tilting breechblock and a detachable box magazine, although troops were only issued extra magazines later in the war."

Starting in 1933, the Ottoman Empire updated their old rifles to a common configuration known as the Model of 1938 and all in 8x57 Mauser cartridge. The standardisation of all Mausers in Ottoman inventory helped ease the logistical nightmare of having to supply 4 different types of rifle ammunition to all units. As a client state of the Ottoman Empire, Yemen also began to slowly adopt the M38 and standardize around the 8x57mm rifle cartidge."
