CAL_covenant:0 "The Sacramento Covenant"
CAL_covenant_desc: "§RAmerica died in 1940.§!\n\n§YAmerica was reborn in 1946.§!\n\nThe Sacramento covenant is the foundation of our western republic. It’s spark came from the late General Stilwell, a man who saw the glow of liberty’s torch from within the belly of the red behemoth. In the spirit of his dream the statesmen of old America; Long, Macarthur, and Merriam came together to reconstitute the nation.\n\nWe may have our differences, and have descended from disparate factions. Yet we all share in our covenant, and like the thirteen colonies of old we shall overcome. Let none of us be held at fault for the crimes of the past. After all, we all have a common enemy."
CAL_prosperity:0 "The Western Prosperity"
CAL_prosperity_desc: "Within the continent sized carnage that is North America, the Pacific Coast stands as a beacon. Capital flight from the east, comparatively undamaged industry, an abundance of natural splendour, and a population boom characterise our sunny beaches and foggy forests. Despite the world economic collapse and the destruction of the Federal Reserves, our new economy are steadily climbing not only to recovery but prosperty. The Californian century truly is here, and it's inciting action shall be the reuniting of our nation!"
CAL_the_caravan:0 "The Caravan"
CAL_the_caravan_desc: "This land is not closed to those who wish to live in it and we welcome all with open arms. But so many newcomers are present that they are an issue to our administration, and especially to our people. They are the subject of complaints by many of our own. Our security forces are strained and the stability of our land is disrupted. While it is hoped that we can put them all to work, for they are many, they are not going to stay here forever, nor will such a hope be free of additional expenses."
