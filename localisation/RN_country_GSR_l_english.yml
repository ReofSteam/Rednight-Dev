### Ideas ####
GER_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
GER_recovering_economy_desc:0 "Germany was devastated by the Second Weltkrieg. Entire cities were nearly levelled by a combination of aerial bombings, artillery and street to street fighting. The great industrial areas in Berlin, Saxony and the Rhineland were hit exceptionally hard. Many factories were destroyed, leaving industrial output significantly lower than before the war. Additionally, many of our harbours were left unusable, and hundreds of farms were left abandoned. The damage is not something that can be repaired in a day. It will take time, resources and a whole lot of patience. In the meantime, very few Germans find excitement in the prospect of war."
GER_unlikely_friendship:0 "An Unlikely Friendship"
GER_unlikely_friendship_desc:0 "Nearly four decades after the split of the Second International, reformists and revolutionaries have united once again. Looking back, it is easy to understand just how complex this situation is. After all, the SPD was active in suppressing trade unionism and revolutionary socialism for years, and supported the ban on the early KPD. However, today is a different time. The SPD has new leadership after its own suppression by the former right-wing military dictatorship, and the KPD has finally been given the chance to rise to prominence. President Otto Grotewohl was a compromise candidate between these once bitter rivals. What remains to be seen, however, is if this coalition will hold in the coming years."
GER_bavarian_separatism:0 "Bavarian Separatism"
GER_bavarian_separatism_desc:0 "Unfortunately, not everyone is pleased to be a part of a socialist Germany. In the south a number of reactionary Bavarians wage a campaign of separatism, seeking to form an independent Bavaria that would likely be Russian-aligned. Of course we cannot allow this to happen, but eliminating this threat is not as simple as it would seem. The actions of the separatists are not always so obvious. Subtle acts of sabotage are more common than outright attacks, at least for now, and this situation continues to seriously undermine our control over Bavaria."
GER_reactionary_threat:0 "The Reactionary Threat"
GER_reactionary_threat_desc:0 "Although the reactionary German Empire was defeated, a new reactionary force emerged in the east. The German People’s State, a puppet state of the Russians, continues to pose a threat in more ways than one. Most regrettable is their control over Dresden, one of the great industrial cities of Saxony, and their proximity to Berlin. Their existence also poses an ideological alternative to socialism, which could drive some of our internal opponents to align with them."

gerfla.1.d:0 "Now that this new germany has a chance to reinvent itself, it has the possibility to so, atleast in one way, by chosing a new anthem. The candidates for the new german national anthem that will present it to the world are as followed: \n "Auferstanden aus Ruinen" by Hanns Eisler is supposed to represent the new path of germany and has some strong support by the population. \n "Die Internationale" as translated into German by Emil Luckhardt was proposed many times to represent germanys new internationalist ideology and to show that the German people have abonded the ill-fated idea of nationalism. \n "Die Arbeitsmänner" written by Johann Most to the melody of "Zu Mantua in Banden" by Julius Mosen is to show the world at large that we are a working class nation build on socialism now. That Germany now embraces and fully commits itself to the socialist idea. \n And atlast "Das Lied der Partei" by Luis Fürnberg was proposed as the new german national anthem by the Kommunistischen Partei Deutschlands (Zentralismus) to show how the party will lead Germany into a bright new future and to present to all the importance and the righteousness of the party.

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_OTTO_GROTEWOHL_DESC:0 "§YPresident of the German Socialist Republic§!\n\nOtto Grotewohl was born on the 11th of March, 1894, to a working class German family in Brunswick. He began his career as a book printer and joined the SPD shortly before the outbreak of the Great War, where he was conscripted. He aligned himself with the anti-war left-wing of the SPD that became the USPD, but rejoined the SPD along with most of the USPD in 1918.\n\nAfter the war he joined the majority of the SPD in opposing the military dictatorship and, after its fall, was elected to the local parliament in Brunswick. In 1925 he became the head of the local SPD branch in Brunswick, but resigned in 1931. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1932. After the SPD victory in the 1937 elections, he was appointed Minister of Labour under Chancellor Otto Wels. Wels died suddenly on the 16th of September, 1939, shortly after the onset of the 2nd World War. The Kaiser used the opportunity to replace the SPD cabinet with a wartime conservative cabinet.\n\nHe again placed himself on the left-wing of the SPD, opposing the war and the conservative government that descended into dictatorship. Despite his parliamentary immunity, he was imprisoned under the 1943 anti-socialist laws. With the front collapsing, he was released on the 12th of August, 1946, only three days before the surrender. He established himself as the leader of the left-wing of the SPD and led the party into a coalition with the underground KPD. With the establishment of the German Socialist Republic, he was appointed President as part of the KPD-SPD compromise. However, the ideological rifts between the KPD and SPD have yet to be healed and it remains to be seen whether Grotewohl can keep the two parties together in the coming years."
