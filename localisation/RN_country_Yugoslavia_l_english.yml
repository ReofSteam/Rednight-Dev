At least 3 people died, with a dozen or more injured by this terrorist attack. While police have not arrested anybody in connection to this act of crime, it is highly suspected that Albanian nationalists are responsible for the bombing."

YUG_balkan_dream:0 "The Balkan Dream"
YUG_balkan_dream_desc:0 "Since the Foundation of our nation, Tito has dreamed of the Balkans united against imperialism and foreign threat. With the election of the marxists to Bulgaria's parliament and the agreement of Hoxha's Albania, we can finally bring this dream into reality. The Balkans shall be united, stronger than ever!"
YUG_move_to_titograd:0 "Move to Titograd"
YUG_move_to_titograd_desc: "Although Belgrade is certainly a city to behold, it is populated by a massive majority of serbs. This is frowned upon by our croatian populace, and thus we've decided that moving the capital is a way, to lower secessionist voices. A prime location for this is Titograd, formerly Skopje. Although with sizeable minorities of bulgarians and albanians, Titograd seems like the best choice for a new capital, seeing as it doesn't have large populations of either croats or serbs."
YUG_protect_titograd:0 "Protecting Titograd"
YUG_protect_titograd_desc:0 "As it is our new capital, protecting Titograd is one of our top priorities. Close to the borders of Greece and Bulgaria, it is vulnerable to attacks from both. This has to change."
YUG_titograd_airport:0 "Titograd Airport"
YUG_titograd_airport_desc:0 "As it is our new capital, providing Titograd with an airport is one of our top priorities. This would greatly help transport from the capital quickly reach other big cities in the country. It would also be a great base for our airforce, should war ever come."
YUG_titograd_infra:0 "Titograd Infrastructure"
YUG_titograd_infra_desc:0 "As it is our new capital, developing Titograd's infrastructure is one of our top priorities. This would greatly improve transport links with neighbouring Albania and Greece, and allow for quick mobilization of the army, should the time come."
YUG_titograd_industry:0 "Industry in Titograd"
YUG_titograd_industry_desc:0 "As it is our new capital, developing Titograd's industrial capacity is one of our top priorities. This would largely benefit the city's economy and our war effort, should we go to war."
YUG_monuments_in_titograd:0 "Monuments in Titograd"
YUG_monuments_in_titograd_desc:0 "As it is our new capital, creating new monuments in Titograd really shouldn't be one of our top priorities. Nevertheless we must give the city a more western look."
YUG_titograd_capital_building:0 "A Capital Building"
YUG_titograd_capital_building_desc:0 "As it is our new capital, we need to build new administrative buildings in Titograd. The old ones just won't do."
YUG_administrative_divisions:0 "Administrative Divisions"
YUG_administrative_divisions_desc:0 "Although technically united,our nation is broken up into several demographical areas. There's the croats in the north the serbs to the east and the complicated region of Bosnia inbetween the former two. We must decide on administrative divisions to separate or unite the three nations."
YUG_the_one_people:0 "One People"
YUG_the_one_people_desc:0 "There is only one solution to our problem - the serbs have shown time and again they would die for their country and the ideals of slavic unity. The croats and bosniaks have only proven themselves as liabilities in this great state, thus they won't be granted the same rights as the first group. Of course, this would outrage both of the other groups."
YUG_kosovo_je_srbija:0 "Kosovo je Srbija"
YUG_kosovo_je_srbija_desc:0 "Now arises the question of Kosovo, an area historically populated by both serbs and albanians. Although, Hoxha's Albania is a client state of ours, albanians in our territory have made problems for years now. The only solution is to deport them back to their home state. Kosovo je Serbia!"
YUG_the_two_peoples:0 "The Two Peoples"
YUG_the_two_peoples_desc:0 "There is only one solution to our problem - the serbs and croats must build up our great country side by side. Their constant bickering won't get us anywhere, we must separate them into two different administrative regions, that way the unity shall be confirmed. Of course, serbian nationalists won't like this one bit."
YUG_kosovo_je_kosovo:0 "Kosovo je Kosovo"
YUG_kosovo_je_kosovo_desc:0 "The people of Kosovo are a distinct combination of both albanian and serbian cultures. It wouldn't be right to classify them as one or the other. Kosovo is a unique nation and we believe in that."
YUG_the_three_peoples:0 "The Three Peoples"
YUG_the_three_peoples_desc:0 "Both croats and bosniaks deserve equal leverage with the serbs. The only path to uniting our nation is full and total equality between the three peoples. Bosnia and Croatia must be their own administrative regions."

YUG_privatize_civ_industry_desc:0 "Seizing the means of production has proven counter-productive. We need to transfer ownership of the factories to private owners. Granted, they will pay us handsomely for that."
YUG_encourage_mil_industry:0 "Encourage Military Industry"
YUG_encourage_mil_industry_desc:0 "We have not stayed oblivious of the situation outside our country. Tensions between our dear Internationale and the authoritarian SARPAC have been growing, with both of them ramping up their military budgets. We must not fall behind our revolutionary brothers."

YUG_state_of_the_military_desc:0 "The Yugoslav Army is in an abysmal state currently, with disorganization nearly everywhere. If Yugoslavia is to be a nation that will be able to defend itself, these problems must be remedied right away."
YUG_a_real_army:0 "A Real Army"
YUG_a_real_army_desc:0 "While the partisans were no doubt extremely useful in the War of National Liberation, the time is dawning where disorganized militias will become a liability to our army's ability to defend the nation. War, from now on, must be entrusted to experienced officers and the students of war."
YUG_encourage_service:0 "Service"
YUG_encourage_service_desc:0 "Without men, an army is but a skeleton. We should immediately encourage Yugoslavs to serve and begin providing incentives for enlisting in the armed forces. A massive recruitment campaign should do the trick."

YUG_loyalty_desc:0 "In a war, there is no room for disobedience. We must instill order and discipline into the troops, so that the army can operate at maximum efficiency."
YUG_hierarchy:0 "Hierarchy"
YUG_hierarchy_desc:0 "War is fundamentally anti-democratic. Contrary to what the anarchists and other rabblerousers say, an army without hierarchy is a disaster waiting to happen. Until the revolution is completely won and the reaction no longer poses a threat, hierarchy is completely necessary for the continued functionality of the Yugoslav National Army and the ability to ensure military victory."
YUG_military_industry:0 "Military Industry"
YUG_military_industry_desc:0 "Beyond fighting on the front, the battle of the industry must never end. While Yugoslav military industry is currently unorganized, with military assistance and direct state action we may begin to organize the industries into something greater, something that will give every man a rifle and bullets to fire at all points of a war."
YUG_militarist_mindset:0 "Militarist Mindset"
YUG_militarist_mindset_desc:0 "The ordinary citizen of Yugoslavia must be told that, even when there is peace, this is merely a pause in Yugoslavia's struggle for survival. When war comes, Yugoslavs must be ready; and when war comes, Yugoslavs WILL be ready."
YUG_officers_school:0 "School for Officers"
YUG_officers_school_desc:0 "As of now, our new officers are somewhat unskilled and in need of more training and the knowledge to conduct a war. The best way to solve this, of course, would be a massive program to create academies and officer's schools modeled after those of the Commune of France."
YUG_arsenal_of_the_revolution:0 "Arsenal of the Revolution"
YUG_arsenal_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "If we wish to maintain our independence as a people and prevent our people from being forcefully broken up again, we must be able to produce more than enough arms for our industry, thus ensuring that we will never be unequipped."
YUG_strategic_defenses:0 "Strategic Defenses"
YUG_strategic_defenses_desc:0 "Our nation has already seen much devastation, and although the people wish to avoid another war on our own territory, we must take action to ensure that key strategic points can resist a determined enemy offensive."

YUG_offensive_plans:0 "Take the Initiative"
YUG_offensive_plans_desc:0 "Battles are increasingly being decided not by preparations, but by the individual initiative of officers and tactics akin to speed and trickery. It will take us far if we can drill these ideas into our army, and loosen the traditions of set-piece battles."

YUG_trust_the_partisans_desc:0 "The Partisans are the heart and the soul of the newly-born Yugoslav nation. Unfortunately, they are under assault by those who think a more hierarchial, centralized form of armed forces must be instituted and the militias must be dissolved. Let them believe what they want - this is the time for the people's militias to take the field and lead the charge!"
YUG_guerrilla_tactics:0 "Guerrilla Tactics"
YUG_guerrilla_tactics_desc:0 "While our militias are impressive, everyone tries not to admit it, but there are nations with armies outnumbering and outgunning us to incredible magnitudes - some, we can just not hope to match.

YUG_decimated_by_war:0 "Decimated by War"
YUG_decimated_by_war_desc:0 "The War of National Liberation, despite it's successes, has taken a huge toll on the nation of Yugoslavia. Much is still in need of repair, and now that peace has been achieved, the Yugoslav people will not let it be taken away from them easily."
YUG_legacy_of_the_liberation:0 "Legacy of the Liberation"
YUG_legacy_of_the_liberation_desc:0 "During the War of National Liberation, our eternal Marshal Tito and many other heroes, with the help of the Internationale, gathered their collective strength to evict the Austrian occupiers and bourgeois parasites from our country through a hard-fought guerrilla campaign that eventually created Yugoslavia as we know it. The people of Yugoslavia, though war-weary, will defend their nation to the last drop of blood, on the last mountain."
YUG_legacy_of_the_liberation2:0 "Defend the Homeland"
YUG_antagonistic_unions:0 "Antagonistic Unions"
YUG_antagonistic_unions_desc:0 "Inspired by orthodox marxist and anarchist thought that hails from the member nations of the Internationale, unions in Yugoslavia are gaining more strength and seek to transform Yugoslavia into the socialist nation they desire."
YUG_chetniks_in_military:0 "Chetniks in the Military"
YUG_chetniks_in_military_desc:0 "Chetnik sympathies in the military still remain after the War of National Liberation, as many royalists are angered that the Karađorđević dynasty has not yet been restored to the throne. Needless to say, this does cause a lot of problems, with intentionally-bumbled orders, lack of morale, and supplies that suddenly wind up "missing"."
YUG_kosovo_tensions:0 "Kosovo Tensions"
YUG_kosovo_tensions_desc:0 "Kosovo, a region that has historically always had a large amount of Albanians and Serbians attempting to assert their ethnic dominance, still sees flare-ups of ethnic conflict to this day, despite close relations with Albania itself..."
YUG_army_question:0 "The Army Question"
YUG_army_question_desc:0 "The War of National Liberation saw an amount of irregular warfare on a scale that the Balkans had never seen before, with untold amounts of partisan detachments, militias, and army units taking up arms to fight for Yugoslavia. Ever since the conclusion of the war and the achievement of a united Yugoslavia, rapid demobilization meant that there was never truly a chance to sort out the mish-mash of militias that the Yugoslav "army" was and still is. Uncertainty reigns within the nation on what should be done with the land forces; however, there is a consensus that this question must be answered one way or another."
