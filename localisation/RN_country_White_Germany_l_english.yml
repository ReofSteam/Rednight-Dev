prs.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Prussia"
prs.1.d:0 "bla bla bla intro"
prs.2.t:0 "Our Place in the Sun"
prs.2.d:0 "And just like that, the old fool had dozed off again.\n\nDoenitz quietly chuckled to himself upon this realization, as it only underscored the palpable absurdity of his weekly "meetings" with the geriatric monarch. Quietly rising from the bedside, he poured himself a glass of something both sweet and burning, and stood before the window. Below, Russian soldiers continued to march in formation, withdrawing east. The striking nature of the scene was not lost upon the admiral turned Prussian Regent, and soon he found words compelled from his lips. The meeting would continue, even if Wilhelm himself was not truly present.\n\n"Ah, it's all a big show you know." he muttered while subtly shifting the ice cubes around his glass "My title, your title, the titles of those schemers in Paris." \n\n"The names change, the flags too, but the show never stops. Life's a great game, mein Kaiser, and the people hate losers. Soon this story will reach its climax yet again, and when it does, I will be there." He smirked silently before continuing "After all, better a man with an Marshall's baton then one who can't even keep his eyes open."\n\nHe finished his drink and quietly excused himself from the room, contemplating as he traveled down the steps. Outside this room, Germany awaits..."
prs.2.a:0 "Heil, Kaiser, dir."
prs.10.t:0 "Veterans and Expelees Affair Meeting"
prs.10.d:0 "The truth is painful, yet it persists. Our kingdom has survived only through the sacrifice of millions of patriotic soldiers. In a just world, these men would be welcomed home as heroes. Instead, many find themselves exiled and penniless. With the collapse of our empire and the heavy reparations placed upon our small territory, we cannot afford to pay this many homesick soldiers. Each day the exiled veterans grow more restless and the government more helpless. We must come to a settlement./n/n The economic ministry has suggested a bold plan; to devalue the Reichsmark to pay, with Russian loan to stabilise the currency. While this will undoubtedly cause more inflation and further debt it should allow us to calm these men in the short term.\n\nAnother option would be to organize the men into state sponsored public works projects. However this would be expensive would require anger inducing taxes on the Prussian gentry or printing more money, the backbone of our feeble economy.\n\nA final option is simply to batten the hatches and cut spending. Maybe austerity can ride out the storm?"
prs.10.a:0 "A fruitful meeting, at least they are heard"
prs.11.t:0 "The Russian Loan"
prs.11.d:0 "Only two decades ago Moscow was paying reparations to our fatherland and the vast resources of our empire stood at the Kaiser’s command.\n\nToday, the absurdity is so thick one must wade through it.  It is no secret that Russia is not the most ideal of an economic partner. Yet in light of lingering grudges and the fallout of our recent war with the Polish backstabbers, they remain our only option.\n\n Russia will not send us money free of consequences. Yet in the short term, this must be done. We will beg for respite from reparations and expanded aid in order to prevent total disorder. If the Kingdom is to survive, personal pride must  be abandoned for now."
prs.11.a:0 "Auf wiedersehen, Herr Ambassador"
prs.12.t:0 "Request for a Loan"
prs.12.d:0 "The Prussian delegation has arrived in Moscow today. They were forthcoming in their desires, expressing their need of an economic aid package to stay afloat.The fact that those that once oppressed the slavic people now grovel at our feet is an amusing testament to the strength of the Vohzd.\n\n As for the proposal, it has some merit. While we are by no means a rich nation ourselves, we are certainly better off than that debt ridden remnant. Prussia has the potential to be our greatest proxy in Europe. Perhaps by granting such a request, it would be easier to gain influence over their nominally independent government. Is a payout worth the opportunity?"
prs.12.a:0 "Have the State Bank director comes over"
prs.12.b:0 "Let the Teutons die with their ragged pride"
prs.13.t:0 "The Loan failed to manifest"
prs.13.d:0 "The deal with Moscow has failed! The arrogant bastards have refused to save our fragile economy. It seems they do not care what kind of disorder their actions will create. Prussia now finds itself in a great calamity.Without foreign aid, all of our economic schemes is in serious jeopardy and alarming castatrophic inflation. A drastic measure ought to be taken. Should we cut our losses?"
prs.13.a:0 "Austerity must be implemented"
prs.13.b:0 "Tell Speer to come here"
prs.20.t:0 "A Meeting with Mr.Speer"
prs.20.d:0 "Albert Speer, a civilian bureaucrat, opened the door to find himself standing before medals and caps. The dissonance struck him each day, never abating. Sometimes he wished he had a rank to his name. It would have given him credibility amongst the junta. Then again, no other man in this room actually know how the economy works.\n\nSpeer nodded to each member seated at the table. Yet when he reached Donitz, their eyes locked. The back of his neck grew warm and he adjusted his tie. He turned his gaze to Von Schleicher instead. \n\n “Sirs, Our monetary scheme has been a resounding success!\nVon Schleicher indulged Speer out of probable spite for Donitz.\n\n“With our newfound surplus we should be able each soldier what he is rightly owed. In addition, all indications of inflation remain concealed behind work bills.”\nDonitz pointed to a file in Speer’s hands.“Give me that.”\n\nHe took his time, silence reigned for several minutes. Finally, Von Schleicher found himself impatient.\n“Karl. What of it?”\n\n“This is unsustainable! What will happen when they realize inflation has made their newfound pay utterly worthless?! You have dragged us into this programme, surely you have a plan beyond concealment?”\n\n Speer boiled internally as Doenitz demonstrated his rudimentary understanding of economic. They had requested a way to stop the bleeding, to calm dissident soldiers, yet now a permanent solution that didnt offend someone? He was not god.\n\n “What would you have me do?!\nThe room erupted into a debate."
prs.20.a:0 "Whats worse, angry people with guns or market crash?"
prs.20.b:0 "What sort of idiots think you can just print money?"
prs.19.t:0 "Heinemanns Soapbox"
prs.19.d:0 "Gustav Heinemann moved his feet slowly, planting one on each stair as if they were made of wet concrete and he intended to avoid a mess. He clutched a prepared statement, revised yesterday evening. Gustav had a tendency to passionately argue, and even cut down today's statements would be such a thing.\n\nHe reached the podium and began speaking to the assembled crowd below. To his left stood Kurt Schumacher, a social democrat infamous for his uncompromising zeal. To his right was Papen, an old nationalist staple, and yet age had not dulled his fox-like nature.Papen would be vital to their movement, commanding prestige and extensive connections.\n\nGustav spoke first of what they shared, their common love for the Fatherland and their wish to see it whole again. He spoke of his compatriots, men of the old reichstag who had put aside their ideological differences. He shared nostalgia, a reminiscence on old ways and alternate futures.Finally, when the audience was captive, he began his tirade.\n\nHadn't the German people endured enough misery? What sense was there in continuing with those who had failed against the socialists? Even now, in the crowd below, stood abandoned veterans, exiled westerners, and impoverished families.\n\n The Junta had no vision. The Junta had no plans for the future. The people yearned for peace, bread, and elections. These were rights, not priveleges. Donitz and his cabal had no right to behave as they did!\n\nAs the speech wound down and the crowd filtered away from the Landtag building he surveyed them. There was no great celebration. The citizens of Danzig were far too weary, far too jaded. Yet for every glassy eyed man there was another who shook his head quietly in approval. Some began to gather in whispered discussion.\n\nGustav smiled and turned to Schumacher. Perhaps they truly had captured the public sentiment?"
prs.19.a:0 "It is easy to criticize from the sidelines."
prs.19.b:0 "The future of Germany?"
prs.21.t:0 "Eulogies and Conspiracies"
prs.21.d:0 "Lars planted himself on the bench, pretending the book in his lap had enveloped him. As he read  the branches behind him rustled inconveniently. A curse escaped his lips. They were just loud enough to impair his hearing.At least Lars was an attentive man, and his inconspicuous size and dress worked to his advantage. He scanned the area for an alternative perch. This would have to do.\n\n The first man, Karl-Heinz Keiter, leaned heavily against a pillar. Lars had only caught a brief glimpse, but  body language was telling. Slumped shoulders and tired eyes were to be expected when one received an award on behalf of their dead father. Tortured by communists! How could a son not buckle under such burdens?\n\nThe second was §R[GetHEERConspiratorName]§!. He was a [GetHEERConspiratorNameDesc] who served under Marshal Rommel in the war. Today he had assumed the role of surrogate parent. It made sense for a man who supposedly "looked out" for his own troops. Why not Major Keitel as well?\n\n Lars smiled as §R[GetHEERConspiratorName]§!'s voice rose. His passion had overtaken the branch rustling. They spoke first of the award and eulogy, of how Keitel's father would have been proud. Duty. Honor. Sacrifice. Nothing was yet incriminating. Still, Lars took his notes.\n\n Keitel hoped his service might honor his father, and §R[GetHEERConspiratorName]§! agreed. Service to the Fatherland was surely honorable, service to the state on the other hand was not.\n\n §R[GetHEERConspiratorName]§! considered it an outrage! To confine proud patriots to a poor remnant kingdom led by a pretending fool, Donitz was an honorless man who allowed his troops to go hungry and his citizens to be divided. Keitel didn't agree outright, enduring the tirade silently. When he finally spoke Lars grinned. It seemed grief had gotten the better of the man. He had all he needed."

prs.17.d:0 "Officials from every branch of government, armed forces, and even foreign delegations arrived today in Konigsberg. They pushed there way through the crowds being held back by police lines and into a great cathedral. It was there that an ornate casket was eulogized by a city pastor.\n\nWhen the ceremony was finished the casket was ferried outside draped in the Reich’s old flag. The crowd outside fell silent, and though the sky was cloudless each face grew dark. Once the body was loaded into a car, each representative made his way to the cemetery\n\nThey made a circle as the casket landed softly in the black soil. Then came the weeping. For every stern faced fellow there was another whose eyes were bloodshot and lids puffy.\n\nNone truly wept for the long bed-ridden man himself. Instead, their hearts were stirred by a greater loss. They mourned a way of life. They mourned fallen glory and dead empires. They mourned futile flags and dead ideas. It was for these things that patriotic hearts cried, for they knew something was lost that could never be regained."

prs.23.d:0 "Centuries of blood boiled. He felt the veins in his arm ache, as if a thousand dead ancestors were crying out in spiritual anguish.\n\n"Fucking Ivan!" he thought to himself as the ship docked.\nThough he had become skilled in realpolitik, Admiral Doenitz had never lost his patriotic urges. Thankfully, this one was kept to himself.A familiar face descended the steps and nodded to the Admiral. The Russian Ambassador; a troublesome ally.\n\n The ambassador was suddenly flanked by an entourage, emerging from the cramped metal doorway. Mostly military men whose steps on German soil had become a frequent indignity. Doenitz squinted his eyes and scanned each man. One, in the back, stood out.\n\n He was a slender fellow. A tall grey haired tree with evil eyes. Unlike his compatriots, he wore only a suit. As the entourage grew closer Doenitz suddenly understood from the small red pin on his lapel. This was the infamous §R[GetGRUConspiratorName2]§! of the GRU. He was the Russian Spymaster and right hand of the Kornilovite regime.\n\nDoenitz shook the hand of each man and his anger compounded. Not only was §R[GetGRUConspiratorName2]§! present, but so too were two other harsh figures. The upstart colonel, §R[GetGRUConspiratorName1]§!. He was the scourge of Division III military intelligence, and his grip was characteristically firm. Then there was Aleksandr Turznowicz; a true hardliner of Sloevian origin.\n\nThe pleasantries were dispensed with. Doenitz forced a smile as he led the bastards deeper into the city. It was quite an interesting crowd considering the Russians spoke of "peaceful cooperation". There could be no doubt now that something was amiss. He felt his chest tense with paranoia."

PRS_last_kaiser_desc:0 "Wilhelm III is a name that will forever live in infamy, uttered on the lips of every historian. The Kaiser to be lead our people to sweet glory in 1918, and in 1946 he bore witness to our greatest failure. Though he has aged, the man still plays his role as the ultimate face of German politics. He is a symbol of German honor, and of days long past. For now, he still endures."

PRS_fragile_economy_desc:0 "There is no use beating around the bush, the Reich's economy has utterly collapsed. Ironically, the worst symptoms of this crisis have grown less severe since the enemy gained control of most of our land. Yet our old problems are steadily being replaced with new ones. Post-War repatriations, unpaid loans, and annihilated businesses categorize our remnant kingdom. We must tread carefully as we carry the heavy weight of this problem upon our backs, lest we tumble over!"

PRS_westerners_desc:0 "Two million German exiles and 600,000 demobilized veterans. The numbers speak for themselves. It takes great effort to convince a Rhinelander and a Bavarian that they must suffer for the good of a state called "Prussia"."

POLITICS_LEVITOV_DESC:0 "For his victory in the Battle of Memel, General Levitov was granted control over the Russian occupation of Germany and made Marshall of Prussia by the Vohzd.  This was a fitting post for the so called “Black Colonel”, a man who was famously photographed mid stride on horseback, as his armies decimated Baltic German Forces.\n\n Of the two German governments Levitovs is the most powerful. Yet Konigsberg is lucky, for the Marshall has grown to care little for the job. To him, it is a distraction from important matters in Moscow. In addition, Levitov is a bit of a Tuetonophile, marginally preferring the Germans to the Poles.\n\n When hands need to be shaken, they are shook. When Silesian disputes need mediation, they are apathetically mediated. As long as the border fortifications continue to be built up, The Marshal of Prussia shall remain distracted, content to let the remnant state bicker amongst itself."

POLITICS_DOENITZ_DESC:0 "Karl Von Donitz is no longer a promising upstart, praised to the heavens by his superiors. Indeed, he now has no superior. Not even the Kaiser can control the ambitious admiral. Karl has become a man with grand designs and Machiavellian interests. He seeks total control over the Prussian Kingdom, and rules alongside his junta with the blessing of sickly and geriatric monarch.\n\n Yet Donitz seems unaware of his own predicament. While it is true that he “saved the Reich” by helping negotiate a Prussian Kingdom, most of the populace still dubs his government the “capitulators”. The Prussian aristocracy has lost confidence in him, as have the remaining German business interests. The veterans are equally displeased, with many simply wanting to return home in the west.\n\n Karl intends to reclaim the nation when the Kaiser dies. History will tell of the Admiral's ambitions"
