### Ideas ###

TEX_anti_long:0 "Longist-Committee Struggle"
TEX_anti_long_desc:0 "The hand of the Committee is light upon the people of America. Those under its protection are better off than coming under the boots of the Reds. However, it is not perfect, for it was once the home of Huey Long. His influence lingers, and many still cling to his ideals. It is important to take care when dealing with these activists."
TEX_soldiers_nation:0 "The Soldiers Nation"
TEX_soldiers_nation_desc:0 "This is a land of soldiers. Its mayor is an Admiral. Its grocery store owned by a captain. Men and women of the 9th and 15th Armies, as well as those of the southern navy, live here. No blade of grass is without the protection of those who served under Stillwell and Leahy. It will be unwise to anyone, especially the Reds, to come here and mess with the people."
TEX_soldiers_nation_desc:0 "Though our aspirations are grand and noble present realities and the history of our goverment necessitate continued martial law. We are a nation of Soldiers presiding over the civilian population, and will continue to be so until the situation stabilises."
TEX_gun_and_rose:0 "Of Bayonet and Rose"
TEX_gun_and_rose_desc:0 "The beauty of the South was once reduced to ashes and mud by the battles of the war before. At Louisiana, territory has been seized and lost many times by the Reds and their foes. The years 1945 and 1947 will not be forgotten by those who have fought and lived through them all. The promise of restoring the beauty of this land must be fulfilled. Not only for victory through arms and through policies, but through the revitalization of what matters so much to the people."
