RN_1950_NAME:0 "A Nightmare in Europe"
RN_1981_NAME:0 "The Apocalypse War"
RN_1950_DESC:0 "From the straits of Gibraltar to the rolling hills of Scotland, a new day has dawned on old Europe.\n\n The Final struggle approaches; a battle for the very soul of Humanity. All powers must choose a side, or face annihilation. The end may be nigh…"
RN_1981_DESC:0 "As the pride of humanity rules unchallenged in his kingdom, its enemy remains only one - Humanity themselves. And so it begun the last war to end all wars, the war for ...APOCALYPSE"
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1946, Germany went from the hegemon and oppressor of the world to an occupation zone. Once secure in their dominance, the shock of defeat by the French, and by the godless socialists nonetheless, has left deep scars in the German Psyche.\n\nPlagued by terorrism and the struggle to implement socialist principles, there is much to be done for the new government in Hamburg if Germany is to be whole again."
ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The English tale is one of woe. Formed by spontaneous actions in 1925, the Union of Britain went from a pitifully weak Labour government, to that of the tyrannical strongman Oswald Mosley. Tolerated for the stability he brought to the shattered isles and victory in the war, Mosley's time is running short. \n\nAs the British people begin to shout for a democracy similar to their French counterparts, the Black sheep of the socialist bloc must contend with many factions. Radicals be damned, stay the course!"
FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In every corner of our blue marble, from caves of India to the frigid shores of Patagonia, Paris is a beacon. The French Social Republic is a forerunner of the world to be, has rode the crest of the red tsunami that started in 1918.\n\nHowever,all is not well. The military, emboldened by the second Weltkrieg, grows more independent with time. In addition, while the republic centralised in war, many lament the loss of the  status quo. All the while, the mysterious bureau branches like a tree away from the BGT, ever growing in its worldwide influence. France may lead the new world, but she must ensure once again that she can conquer herself."
