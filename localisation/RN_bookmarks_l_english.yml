KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "The Red Night"
GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1946, Germany went from the hegemon and oppressor of the world to an occupation zone. Once secure in their dominance, the shock of defeat by the French, and by the godless socialists nonetheless, has left deep scars in the German Psyche.\n\nPlagued by terorrism and the struggle to implement socialist principles, there is much to be done for the new government in Hamburg if Germany is to be whole again."

France may lead the new world, but she must ensure once again that she can conquer herself."

The Red banner of labour, so long hidden in attics and whispered about in factory halls, flies free and proud. The prophetic words of Marx, made real in the ashes of two great calamities. Utopians, opportunists, idealists and guerillas alike mingle among the streets of Paris.\n\nAcross the Dnieper, the Russian beast lurks. Sheltering crowned heads, petty tyrants and privileged exiles beneath its wing, it prepares for the final struggle to come, within the Duma there are multiple strains of thought regarding the fulfillment of this duty.The Final struggle approaches; a battle for the very soul of Humanity. All powers must choose a side, or face annihilation. The end may be nigh…"
