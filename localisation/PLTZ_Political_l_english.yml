### Subtype Descriptions ###
marxist_subtype_desc:0 "Marxism is the go-to socialist ideology of many nations. Created by the philosophical thinkers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engles, its beliefs are outlined in the former's book, The Communist Manifesto. Marxism believes in the removal of the Bourgeoisie in order to allow the proletariat to benefit by seizing the means of production and in creating a people’s state as the true political power."
moderate_socialist_subtype_desc:0 "Moderate Socialism is similar to other left teachings in the sense that they all subscribe to the idea of the proletariat holding all the power in the counry, but they differ in many other ways. Moderate socialists, as opposed to the supporters of other anti-capitalist movements, do not believe in a highly Centralized state. While the means of production and all property is held by the state, citizens of countries following Moderate Socialism are allowed to prosper and develop largely on their own."
social_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "Social Democracy is a center-left ideology, and in many countries is the only leftist movement allowed. Social Democrats believe in a Market Economy, albeit one that is heavily regulated to prevent monopolies and unfair conditions for the working class. It is best known for its focus on creating multiple social policies that benefit the unfortunate, aswell as a large welfare state, often times providing free healthcare and education."
social_conservative_subtype_desc:0 "Social Conservatives' ideas are based in tradition and history, believing that as a political force they should advance the country's interests whilst also preserving the traditional ideals of duty, institution and traditional values. The followers of this ideology are also in favor of a semi-regulated free-market economy with government support to realise the idea of a “nation of shopkeepers”. Overall Social Conservatives believe that tradition and reform will bring a nation to its best ideals."
authoritarian_democrat_subtype_desc:0 "With little examples of a working democratic system, governments and state which are considered representatives of this ideology will often claim to follow the nation's voice. These claims however, prove more often than not to be quite hollow and in reality the democratic system in said governments is in most cases quite flawed and not exactly adherent to the democratic ideas and philosophy."
autocratic_subtype_desc:0 "The Autocratic System is mostly used by the undemocratic monarchies and military regimes throughout the world. Representative bodies of this ideology will restrict the press and free speech and little to none democratic institutions, whith those that exist being token bodies with no real power. These regimes tend fall into one of two spectrums, with one being a stable and efficient society, reached by authoritarian measures or a state of general turmoil and impending chaos."
national_republican_subtype_desc:0 "National Republicanism is the belief that fire should be fought with fire. Pioneered by Boris Savinkov, according to this ideology hostility towards the state should be crushed through heroic revolutionary acts in order to bring Justice to a broken system. The heroic legacy of the people should destroy the broken political systems of old whilst also suppressing lefitst elements for a true national society to prosper."
