INC_young_republic_desc:0 "In October 1947 the nascent Indochinese union of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos was violently born.  We have expelled the french and german imperialists and paid for our new republic In blood. Our continued unity ensures that those sacrifices were not in vain, and the people are proud of their new nation. Still there are some grumblings among the Khmer and Champa about Vietnamese taking priority in certain matters, and the people have certainly not forgotten where they come from."

INC_a_fragile_coaltion:0 "A Fragile Coaltion"
INC_a_fragile_coaltion_desc:0 "Our republic is founded on a shaky balance between nationalists and socialists established out of necessity during the revolution. While outwardly equal, in reality the socialists have controlled the nation since its birth. As a result, heated debates frequently break out over everything from economic policy to cultural landmarks. Indochinese politics is the furnace that molds idealistic revolutionaries into cynical politicians. It cannot last in its current, lopsided state."
INC_disunited_military:0 "Disunited Military"
INC_disunited_military_desc:0 "Paramilitaries, partisan militias, scarcely equipped divisions. While we have no shortage of enthusiastic grunts, the overall state of our army is enough to drive any competent commander to madness.

INC_building_our_economy_desc:0 "A century of foreign domination has left our economic situation pitiful and feudal. While slow progress is being made towards fully industrializing our city centers.

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HO_TUNG_MAU_DESC:0 "§YState Preisident of the Union of Indochina and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam§!\nThe elder member of the Revolutionary Party's Politburo was given the office of President of the new republic on the elevation of the Provisional Revolutionary Government to the United Coalition Government and the 1948 Consitution established the office of State President. however as the Union of Indochina is a parliamentary republic on federal level and the national government of Vietnam currently ineffective, his office is more or less, ceremonial"
POLITICS_HOANG_VAN_THAI_DESC:0 "§YChairman of the Resistance-Administrative Committee of the North§!\nAsk any soldier of the north their thoughts on General Van Thai and you will be greeted with nothing but praise. Always steadfast, his image is one of unwavering loyalty, but also humility and sensitivity. Born Hoang Van Xien in 1915, he would spend much of his early life among mineworkers, barbers and musicians. Radicalised in the depths of poverty, Van Thai witnessed firsthand the tragic revolution of 1930 and the white terror that followed. Plunged back into active combat when the FLI launched its 1944 anti-imperialist struggle. Seeing an opportunity to liberate his home province and avenge those that came before he was made leader of the first platoon of the Vietnam Liberation Army. It was in this position that his infamy became unrivaled. With only a 100 man force, he would successfully seize a province capital.\nMade Lt.General in 1949 after studying in Whampoa for a year, Hoang Van Thai is indeed a rare breed. His ambition, dedication and empathy make him ideal to defend his home from the invaders that now besiege it."
POLITICS_PHOUMI_NOSAVAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1920 to a Chinese-Laotian family, few could have predicted the fate of General Phoumi Nosavan. Despite an early career as a colonial civil servant, Nosavan could not help but be swayed by the call of his homeland.\n\nAfter joining Lao Issara forces in the 1947 Revolution, Nosavan would train in Whampoa like many generals of the National Army. Quickly distinguishing himself and building a respectable career among his peers.\n\nNow, as the Indochina war comes to a disastrous end, the General has taken the world upon his shoulders. Refusing to see cowards and traitors destroy the independence he holds dear, he has seized power. It may be too late to win the war, but if he can withdraw from the chaos quickly enough, there may be a chance for salvation. Who knows? The general just might impart his own vision of governance along the way."
POLITICS_TRINH_DINH_CUU_DESC:0 "Despite a lofty record, Trinh Dinh Cuu seems stuck on the periphery. From his early years as the founder of the now defunct Indochinese Communist League, to his high ranking stature from years of subversive activity, one would expect Cuu to be a bold leader. Instead, he is regarded as something of an orbiter. Often he is overshadowed by his own deputies, a position in the Politburo he seemed to accept after the 1946 merger with the revolutionary party.\n\nStill, few can argue with his experience. Especially due to his past friendship with the great martyr Nguyen Ai Quoc.\n\nSo now, much to the chagrin of his numerous critics, Trinh Dinh Cuu adds yet another notable title to his unpopular name, 3rd President of the Union of Republics."

inc.1.t:0 "Day of the Republic"
inc.1.d:0 "As we celebrate our annual “Day of the Republic” and enter the Third Republican Year it is important we look back upon our great history, but also towards our uncertain future.In 1947, the twin shackles of feudalism and colonialism were shattered. Our homeland returned to its people’s hands. To the Viets went Vietnam, to the Laotians went Laos, to the Khmer went Kampuchea. A union of freeborn republics, conceived in liberty and revolutionary fire came to be.\nNow it is 1950, and in those two years since our people stood proudly together much has changed.The government is ruled by the ever fragile “United Coalition Government”. A frankenstein compromise between the leftist Democratic Popular Front and the traditionalist National front. Both formed from smaller parties during the revolution and neither often willing to work with the other.\nIn addition to a seemingly impossible government, the Indochinese economy is now starting from scratch. Its ministers constantly fight to stave off famine and stabilize monetary crises. Industrialisation still seems like a distant dream.Despite bipartisan programmes, Illiteracy also remains common. A remnant of hundreds of years of ngu dân (suppression of basic literacy) by colonial oppressors. Much more will have to be done to improve the situation, after all education is the lifeblood of democracy.The National Army mirrors its government. Constructed from hundreds of highly partisan revolutionary remnants, centralized command is impossible. For this and many other reasons both the NF and DPF maintain their own private militias.\nIn the east, the rising sun looms large. Making more and more aggressive overtures, many in our nation fear the pearl of the orient cannot survive its menace.On this national holiday, we must not lose sight of the work that is to be done. For If we lose sight now, all the martyrs of the revolution may have died in vain."

inc.5.t:0 "German officers will lead the efforts"
inc.5.d:0 "In the twilight hours of yesterday afternoon famous general Nguyen Van To Quoc of the Euro-African Corps arrived via a biplane in Saigon. A Vietnamese by the citizenship forced upon him but is an ethnic German also known as Arno Von Lenski, the General has always been a somewhat controversial outsider. A status compounded by both his heritage and  allegations of crimes against the people during his time within colonial forces. Regardless, it seems that the admiration of his combat record has triumphed over cries of protest within the government. After being restored to his pre-war rank, Lenski's teachings will apparently be used to whip the overzealous militia and disorganized units into shape. A small part of a larger government initiative to modernize the armed forces. Only time will tell if his efforts can accomplish such a task." 
inc.5.a:0 "Good luck, Herr General"

inc.6.t:0 "French officers will lead the efforts"
inc.6.d:0 "After an over 14 hour flight, Communard official Major de Castries has landed in Saigon with his staff officers. Invited by the government, de Castries has accepted command of the newly formed Franco-Indochinese Officer Training Corps. The product of an agreement between the two governments. When asked his opinion of the assignment de Castries appeared stern but enthusiastic, saying he intended to bring "All the traits of a disciplined revolutionary" to each of the "rabble rousing" men under his command. Such a statement is unsurprising given both the Major's record and the current goals of the Indochinese government to modernize its armed forces. An initiative requiring foreign expertise that de Castries likely has in spares."

inc.7.d:0  "A small crowd gathered today in the Haiphong harbor, bearing witness to the return of another ship fulls of Indochinese expats in China. Standing on the ship's deck to accompany the weary returning civilians was Chinese General Hu Lien and a group of officers from the Whampoa Military Academy. Invited to northern Indochina as part of an initiative to help modernize the armed forces. Reporters present described the General as a Jovial man, laughing  and making conversation with soldiers and inquiring about their various homelands. Despite his seemingly informal nature, Hu Lien has an impressive combat record attached to his name. While not from a more disciplined European army, he is likely a safe choice for such a job."

inc.10.d:0 "While elections occured in the time of colonial rule, true mass democracy is a relatively new concept in Indochina. What was once the sole domain of the european clubs, rich capitalists, and scheming plantation owners now belongs to every house and village. As a result, its implementation has been turbid and tumultuous.The 1948 election was a frantic battle in the true meaning of the word. None can truly recall just how many bullets were exchanged in militia shootouts to recover stolen ballot boxes. Fewer still can confirm how many voters found themselves intimidated by gangs to vote one way or another.To say that the results of the election were dubious is an understatement. The First People's Parliament has been based on contribution during the revolution and hasty compromises more then serious ballot counts.\n\nNow, on the eve of yet another election, things are looking to be just as savage. The united coalition government has collapsed, it's absurd contradictions finally ushering in its undoing. In its place, both sides gear up for the final struggle. The future of Indochina for decades to come is about to be sealed. As police forces enact their futile preparations in cities across Indochina. Soon, the militias will storm to the voting places to the sounds of fluttering paper and rifle fire. The time has come to finally decide the destiny of the republic, and the soul of the Indochinese people."

inc.20.d:0 "In 1948, the whole of Indochina came together under a single flag. A centuries old vision of a free and united peninsula had been realized. However all dreams end, and today the vietnamese people finally awoke from their long slumber. The Union of Indochina takes its place in the altar of the past. From its ashes; three republics arise.\nWe tried to build utopia. Bring our Brothers forth with us into the future. Perhaps we were too naive, to believe that the Champa and Khmer shared our vision. Somewhere along the way, we were blinded by glory and got lost in the clouds.To our east, nationalists and pragmatists alike celebrate the deaths of what they saw as an oppressive bureaucracy eternally dominated by the vietnamese. Parades and parties are breaking out in the streets.\nIn Saigon, the city is silent.\nSolidarity and Victory to the Khmer nation, the Champa nation and the Viet nation, may our bound last 'till the last dust of the earth passed away."

inc.28.d:0 "The Vientiane government descended into crisis today after Japanese forces smashed through defensive lines in Upper Laos. General Phoumi Nosavan has launched a successful coup after linking up with the invaders, despite resistance from the loyalist elements of the Laotian National Army and Vietnamese National Guards.\nWhile attempts are being made to form an exile government, the situation appears to be dire. The new "Emergency Government for the Security, Neutrality and Stability of Laos" (GUPSNSL) has disbanded the National Parliament and unleashed a wave of arrests throughout the capital. It appears that for the time being General Nosavan will become undisputed head of state."

Only hours after Kampuchean President Son Ngoc Thanh announced his decision to withdraw from the ongoing war and cut ties with Vietnam, violence erupted.Various revolutionary elements from both the National army and former Free Khmer leftist groups organized themselves around the Tou Samouth’s Democratic revolutionary Party. United and furious with the president's decision they executed a swift coup d’etat.Calling themselves the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic, the new government's first action was to declare solidarity with the vietnamese people and re-enter the struggle against the Japanese "Imperialists".Son Ngoc Thanh himself barely escaped east with a number of loyalists, now no doubt hoping to collect himself and build an opposition in the chaos."

inc.32.d:0 "The last retreating regiments from Hanoi have assembled in Vietbac, the base established in the early days of the Revolution by the Vietnam Liberation Army. It now serves as a temporary capital for all forces and territories of the DRV in the north. Lt. General Hoang Van Thai has assumed command of the Resistance-Administrative Committee and all 4 Resistance zones under its jurisdiction. With the loss of most major cities throughout northern  Vietnam, his command is entirely independent. This is compounded by the extreme difficulty of currently communicating with the central government."
