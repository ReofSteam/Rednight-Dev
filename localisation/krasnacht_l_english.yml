krasnacht.1.desc:0 "Sultan Farouk has been organizing his Birthday Party, a lavish event in his palace in Cairo. The party will of course include all the most important people in Egypt and the world. However, there is still the matter of inviting the Prime Minister, Fouad Serageddin. Serageddin is considered by many to be a "party-pooper" whose intimidating aura and violent personality may put a real damper on the celebrations. His glum attitude may affect the quality of his highness's birthday and may hamper the chance of finding a possible lover at the party."

Muhammad Naguib and Aly Maher, both prominent opponents of Serageddin, have arranged meetings with Farouk. However, Farouk has a busy schedule and only has so much time."
