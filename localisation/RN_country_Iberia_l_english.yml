### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ANGEL_PESTANA_DESC:0 "Ángel Pestaña is one of many syndicalists, yet one of the most influential persons in the Federation. Born in Santo Tomás de las Ollas, El Bierzo, he had a troubled childhood and became an orphan at the age of 14. After travelling around, he settled in Argel, but at the beginning of the First Welktrieg, he moved to Barcelona and affiliated to the trade union CNT. He quickly rose up to promenience, and participated in important strikes such as the Revolutionary General Strike of 1917 as well as the strike of "La Canadiense" in 1919. He got sent to the Soviet Union as a delegate to discuss CNT adhesion to the Third International but the trip got cancelled due to German Intervention, so he returned to Spain. He later supported the CNT adhesion to the French Third International. Despite falling off with the faist sector of the organization, the precarious situation under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera makes him found the short-lived Partido Sindicalista. However, once the Spanish Civil War started, as the CNT was able to gain more relevance he reconciliated with the faist wing of the organization, returning back to leadership and becoming the visible head of the Broad Front government after the death of Francisco Largo Caballero. He participated in the writing of the 1937 constitution, and intends to moderate the writing of a new, unified constitution for the whole of the Federation. However, as he grows older his health is starting to falter, and he questions his own ability to participate in the new constitutional project."
