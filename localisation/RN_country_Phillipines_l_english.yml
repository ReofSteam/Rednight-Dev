PHI_yen_zone:0 "Yen Monetary Zone"
PHI_yen_zone_desc: "While the world economy collapses around us, the Phillipines soldiers on. Much to the dismay of nationalist rebels, it is our relationship with Japan that keeps us afloat.\n\n Implementation of the Yen currency combined with several years of cooperation with the Japanese command economy ensures that things continue as normal as is possible in such chaotic times."
PHI_mountain_rebels:0 "Rebels in the Mountains"
PHI_mountain_rebels_desc: "The arrival of our Japanese benefactors has liberated the nation from the noxious taint of imperialism. With the declaration of joint governance in 1941, and the granting of amnesty to the nationalist leader Aguinaldo in 1947 it was expected that peace would finally reign, yet this was not to be.\n\n Rogue nationalists and stubborn socialist guerillas persist in the mountains, terrorising the populace and assaulting brave Japanese soldiers. We must crush these remnants once and for all before they lead the people astray. Death to the sabatouers!"
PHI_native_attitude_apathetic:0 "Native Attitude: §gApathetic§!"
PHI_native_attitude_apathetic_desc: "While real enthusiasm for the co-prosperity sphere’s mission is exceedingly rare, there is enough ambivalence to keep the people in check. At least for the moment."
PHI_military_monopoly:0 "Japanese Military Monopoly"
PHI_military_monopoly_desc: "Despite the initial US-Japan Co Governing Treaty of 1941, the American trained scout regiments were forcefully disbaneded in 1947 alongside the previously raised National Army. While this was an understandable descision, it has also led to a situation where we are unable to adequately defend ourselves.\n\nDue to legal restrictions on our goverment's ability to raise independent armed forces, we must continue to rely on Japanese troops, mercenaries, and various questionable militas to deal with the growing insurgency."

POLITICS_MASAHARU_HOMMA_DESC:0 "§YMiliary Governor of the Phillipines§!\n\nGovernor-General Masaharu Homma has fought many battles over his long career. Each conquest brought great tribute to both his homeland, and his honor. Homma however, never let these victories inflate his ego.\n\nA true believer in the stated mission of the Co-prosperity sphere, Homma now finds himself in charge of one of his previous victims: the Philippines. It is within this station the aging general will fight his final battle, a battle for the hearts of the people. These islands will be pacified with a gentle but firm hand, and their trust in the empire will be secured."
POLITICS_EMILIO_AGUINALDO_DESC:0 "Criticism of President Aguinaldo, is whispered secretly if it is ever uttered. Aguinaldo is many things; A general, national hero, and the first president of the Philippines. His early years were spent in tireless dedication to free the islands from the spanish-colonial yoke. Later, he fought again to free the nation from weaker men that would cower to the new american invader.\n\nNow, fate has dictated the aging hero return to lead the 2nd republic. A safe choice for a new Philippines, he has accepted Japanese friendship in exchange for this new independence. While his commitments and achievements are undeniable, Aguinaldo is reaching a marvelously advanced age, having been born in 1899.\n\nThough they would never admit it, Aguilnado’s detractors worry that his old age and the hegemon to the north have tamed the grand old hero. However, Aguinaldo has not forgotten who fired at his men on the outskirts of Manilla in 1943. Perhaps the fire of Biak-na-Bato is still burning... "
POLITICS_JOSE_LAUREL_DESC:0 "Jose P. Laurel may be a collaborator, however unlike Begino Aquino he comes off quite genuine. A product of the post-revolutionary generation. And yet, the word “puppet” seems unsuited to a man of such independent convictions.As a younger man, Jose would use his Yale education to argue for his own acquittal. After escaping an attempted murder charge following an attack on a rival suitor of a girl he courted, he would display great talents for law and politics. Eventually, he would even find himself serving on the supreme court.Now, after a long career in politics Jose finds himself the 2nd republic’s president. Always an admirer of the Japanese political system and a staunch nationalist, Laurel sees no need to spout propaganda for a cause he already finds self-evident. He will be straightforward with his people and make his political vision a reality."
POLITICS_BENIGNO_AQUINO_DESC:0 "nThe son of a revolutionary war general, one would be forgiven for assuming Aquino possesed fiery convictions. Instead, one could more accurately describe  Benigno as "Ambitious", for he is highly willing to take opportunities as they arrive.\n\nUnwilling to flee with President Aguinaldo when the Japanese arrived in 1943, Aquino attempted to maintain a semblance of the rump government during the Japanese mandate and the subsequent reign of the PEC. These efforts would grant him the capability and credibility to maintain power.\n\nHowever, regardless of how many speeches he makes, or how many political alliances he maintains Aquino is unpopular among his people. His lack of charisma and his outright propagandistic support of the Co-Prosperity Sphere has created an image of a pragmatic, if unpatriotic man."
POLITICS_HOSHINO_NAOKI_DESC:0 "The posters in Manila shine warmly. They are little sheets full of smiling caricatures and hopeful peasants. Since the liberation Japan has become a big brother! He is caring but firm, helping guide the young and naive Filipinos towards a future free from western imperialists. That is the mission of the executive commission after all, to prepare the Philippines for eventual independence!\n\nYet if one raises their gaze from the posters and towards Commissioner Naoki, their visage is prone to a fall. There are no kind eyes or smiles to be had, only a furrowed brow.\n\nNaoki Hoshino is here for one reason alone; profit. The Philippines are to be sucked dry, and they will sit quietly as it happens! The home islands call out for new resources. Naoki is uncompromising in obliging them. He is ruthless and boring all at once, a deadly and perhaps eventually suicidal combination."
POLITICS_ROXAS_DESC:0 "Manuel entered politics from an early age, swiftly climbing the ranks to become a senator. It was in that capacity he would flee on that fateful day in 1943 alongside Aguilnaldo. Roxas escaped to Mindanao to unite with Quezon and held his ground for a some time. However, as years dragged on Manuel felt the call of his home. Of what use could he be stubbornly hiding in a rural province? Roxas would finally return alongside General Aguinaldo, accepting an amnesty he had before vowed not to. Many call him an opportunist but never one of lesser intellect. Roxas holds his cards close to his chest, ready to return to the great political game he had missed so dearly. He will make the Philippines strong and healthy, regardless of its new role in the world."
