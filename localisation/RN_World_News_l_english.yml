This marked the official surrender of the Deutsches Heer, although fighting in Europe would continue for another month until the capture of Danzig. Despite the war not ending until nearly two years later in the African theatre, citizens on the continent rejoiced that this brutal conflict had come to an end. Many across France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and beyond celebrate today, with extravagant parties and military parades. Though needless to say, the French shall be partying the hardest tonight - with no shortage of champagne."

worldnews.11.d:0 "Months of escalating diplomatic tension between the Union of Indochina and the Empire of Japan have come to an end today, when the National Assembly of Indochina rejected the Japanese ultimatum. The Japanese Empire quickly moved to declare war upon receiving the response, and troops from its garrisons all across South East Asia are preparing to stage a large-scale, surgical invasion into Indochina, where the assembly has declared a state of National Resistance and hastily mobilised its army. The cities of Indochina have been blocked off by barricade after barricade, and militia groups are rapidly forming on the countryside, filled with fervor to defend their homes and the revolution. The Union of the Republics of Indochina is bracing for a brutal impact with the ever-irredentist Rising Sun looking once again to strengthen her grip over Asia. While the militias of the Union pale in comparison to the Imperial armies, every man and woman capable of carrying a rifle is prepared to fight and die for their country and to repel the Japanese behemoth. It remains to be seen whether the Indochinese Union can weather the storm and send the Emperor home reeling, or whether the region will be crushed under the weight of invading Japanese armies. Whatever the result, this war will decide the future of Indochina, and victory will not come without a hefty cost for either participant."

The Imperial Japanese Army has entered Saigon, the Rising Sun along with the original Dragon Star flag were seen hoisted over the Norodom places still covered in bullet holes, a sight has not been seen for 200 years. The remaining army, government and all those who are still loyal to the republic have retreated the jungles and mountain to carry a protracted war. A short convention of the remaining delegates of the union has ended with a unanimous agreement for a dissolution of Indochina. The IJA may have taken the cities but the war is only just beginning. Across the nation, Resistance Radio have broadcast a simple directive "Protracted Struggle". Tens of thousands have taken up arms, the Army of Indochina is only starting to mobilize.\n\nSubhas Chanda Bose, on behalf of the RMK Pact issued a fiery statement today promising “Arms, Bread, Solidarity, and most of all Death to Japanese Dogs!”. Many are unsure how long the native army can last in the face of such brutality. One thing is for sure though, the struggle for Indochina is not over yet! "

worldnews.14.d:0 "Operation Bright Moon has come to an end. The last of the major National Army military formations in Vietnam have been defeated in battlefield. Today the flag of the Republic was torn down from its strongholds in the jungles and mountains, marking the very definitive end of Indochina War. Representatives of the Vietnamese monarchy have received the formal surrender of the rump General Staff, who were shortly thereafter arrested by Japanese authorities. Those not captured appear to have dispersed into hiding, intending either escape or a futile struggle. Regardless, the war is over, and the Republic is no more. For the exhausted populace, today is bittersweet.\n\nA few hours after operations had ceased a spokesperson for the emperor gave a bold public address of the steps of the palace. He stated; “With aid from our gracious Japanese Allies, we have finally vanquished the degenerates and imperialist westerners. The Empire, long displaced by the savagery of western colonialism will once more rule this land. Vietnam will return to the shining jewel of the Far East, as it was for 4000 years! The Dragon star flies high, and the sons of the Dragon lord fulfil their destines.”  "

At 11:30AM, the gold red banner of the Democratic Republic was hoisted once more over the Norodom Palace in Saigon. The Resistance is victorious, but their victory is pyrrhic. The Republic has exhausted almost all its resources and manpower in the long years of total war, as have the Imperial Japanese Army.\nThe newly signed Manilla Accord see the Empire of Japan and its client states officially recognize the lawful existence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, beyond that both sides have failed to gain any other concessions at the diplomacy table. A demilitarized border has divided Vietnam in two, with a reactionary Japanese puppet occupying everything north of the Prefume River.\nAs prisoners of war and Vietnamese Refugees flood south in the finishing chaos, Republican Officials have stated their “Unshakable determination to finish the fight”. It seems a final reckoning will come eventually, Be it by bloodshed or paperwork. However, for now, as the sobbing families bury their dead, quiet times have returned to southeast Asia."
