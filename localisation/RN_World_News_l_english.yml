worldnews.2.d:0 "While national banners may be found across the likes of Belgium or Spain. Germany remains broken. With Its people conquered by the great continental red armies, the populace has had little time to contemplate their future. That ends today.\n\nFollowing a televised announcement from the provisional government in Hamburg a mass exodus of MARPAC forces has begun across Germany. While skeleton crews will remain in key positions for the most part the occupation has officially ended.\n\nIn its place arises a German Republic. For the first time in modern history, there will be no crowned heads in Berlin. While cynics may argue this development was only to create a buffer state between the East and West MARPAC officials have stated numerous reasons for this development. An indefinite occupation, according to them, was neither feasible nor desirable.\n\nAlready powerful forces from across the German political spectrum are preparing their reactions to the news. It remains to be seen what shape the administration will take."

worldnews.1.t:0 "The British Election" 
worldnews.1.d:0 "To an uninformed speculator the British Isles may seem idyllic. Its people remain Separated from continental chaos by the English channel and unthreatened by the specter of the East.Yet somewhat paradoxically, until recent decades British politics was anything but stable. Revolution, counter-revolution, coup attempts, populism and radical reform all found their place north of Calais.\n\nThus while the cities of Paris or Rome are hardly free from controversy, they fail to stack up to London. Ever since the Rise of Oswald Mosley in 1936, complaints of government overreach, abuse, and the stifling of dissent have been common. This was made more severe by the so-called “Revolutionary Industrialisation Program” before the war. Then, those complaints grew dire with the passage of the “Act of Wartime Government” in 1939.\n\nNow it is election season yet again, and the Mosleyite status quo remains all encompassing. As calls for democracy intensify and international condemnation steadily builds the prospects of change still seem doubtful. It matters little whether the English Socialists, Mosleyites, or National Labour candidates win the national elections in the Trade Union Congress. The Chairman’s grip never wanes. His clandestine  influence, as thick as a suffocating cloud, survives on backdoor schemes and a powerful groundswell of patriotic supporters.\n\nStill, on the fringes of British society a radical band gathers; scattered student groups, regional union representatives, old fashioned politicians and military officials. As calls for economic autonomy and democracy grow, they hope for an overthrow.\n\nWill the National Unity government hold, or is a surprise upset in the works?"

worldnews.3.t:0 "New Year Peace"
worldnews.3.d:0 "The trumpets billow, the bugles call, a cold wind whistles through the ruins and the pale horse finds reprise.\n\nSince 1941 the North American continent has more closely resembled hell then anything built by Human hands. Today however, January 1st 1950, a glimmer of hope has arrived. A universal armistice dubbed colloquially as the "New Year's Peace" began its reign a few hours ago. It was birthed with the signing and ratification of the  "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostility and Exchange of Prisoners-of-War in the North American Continent."\n\nJournalists familiar with the conflict have been speculating on such an outcome for around a year. Their speculations were spurred on by a seemingly endless stalemate along the Eisenhower line, the daring destruction of the Trans-Canadian railway and the untimely passing of the constitutional president Jack Reed.\n\nWith the confirmation of these insights comes uncertainty. Will the newly socialist administration of the east be able to rebuild from such devastation? Just how united will the white forces of the south and west remain? Which internal factions will reign supreme on either side? Then there is the ultimate question; How long will such an armistice last?\n\nOnly time will provide the answers. Until then aid will continue to arrive in support of each side, scattered terrorist cells will continue their campaigns, and the restless generals will jockey."
