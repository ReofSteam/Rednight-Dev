worldnews.2.d:0 "While national banners may be found across the likes of Belgium or Spain. Germany remains broken, that ends today.\n\nFollowing a televised announcement from the provisional government in Hamburg a mass exodus of MARPAC forces has begun across Germany. While skeleton crews will remain in key positions for the most part the occupation has officially ended.\n\nIn its place arises a German Republic. For the first time in modern history, there will be no crowned heads in Berlin. While cynics may argue this development was only to create a buffer state between the East and West.\n\nAlready powerful forces from across the German political spectrum are preparing their reactions to the news. It remains to be seen what shape the administration will take."

worldnews.1.t:0 "The British Election" 
worldnews.1.d:0 "Election time has arrived in England, and both the radicals and figures from the mainstream are preparing for the results. Up for grabs is the chairmanship itself, alongside numerous minor posts and positions for representatives in the TUC.\n\nDespite calls for increased democracy intensifying and international condemnation of the Mosleyist administration building the prospects of change still seem doubtful. To international observers It matters little whether the English Socialists, Mosleyites, or National Labour candidates prevail. The Chairman’s grip seems to never wane. His clandestine influence is as thick as a suffocating cloud. It survives on backdoor schemes and  a powerful groundswell of patriotic support. Still, on the fringes of British society scattered student groups, regional union representatives, old fashioned politicians rally for change. Can the Black sheep of the socialist bloc overcome the repressive wartime status quo?"

worldnews.3.t:0 "New Year Peace"
worldnews.3.d:0 "Since 1941 the North American continent has more closely resembled hell then anything built by Human hands. Today however, January 1st 1950, a glimmer of hope has arrived. A universal armistice dubbed colloquially as the "New Year's Peace" began its reign a few hours ago. It was birthed with the signing and ratification of the  "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostility and Exchange of Prisoners-of-War in the North American Continent."\n\nJournalists familiar with the conflict have been speculating on such an outcome for around a year. Their speculations were spurred on by a seemingly endless stalemate along the Eisenhower line, the daring destruction of the Trans-Canadian railway and the untimely passing of the constitutional president Jack Reed.\n\nWith the confirmation of these insights comes uncertainty; How long will such an armistice last?"
