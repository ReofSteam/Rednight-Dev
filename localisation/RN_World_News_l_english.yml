Germany remains broken, that ends today.\n\nFollowing a televised announcement from the provisional government in Hamburg a mass exodus of MARPAC forces has begun across Germany. While skeleton crews will remain in key positions for the most part the occupation has officially ended.\n\nIn its place arises a German Republic. For the first time in modern history, there will be no crowned heads in Berlin. While cynics may argue this development was only to create a buffer state between the East and West.\n\nAlready powerful forces from across the German political spectrum are preparing their reactions to the news. It remains to be seen what shape the administration will take."

worldnews.1.d:0 "Election time has arrived in England, and both the radicals and figures from the mainstream are preparing for the results. Up for grabs is the chairmanship itself, alongside numerous minor posts and positions for representatives in the TUC.\n\nDespite calls for increased democracy intensifying and international condemnation of the Mosleyist administration building the prospects of change still seem doubtful. To international observers It matters little whether the English Socialists, Mosleyites, or National Labour candidates prevail. The Chairman’s grip seems to never wane. His clandestine influence is as thick as a suffocating cloud. It survives on backdoor schemes and  a powerful groundswell of patriotic support. Still, on the fringes of British society scattered student groups, regional union representatives, old fashioned politicians rally for change. Can the Black sheep of the socialist bloc overcome the repressive wartime status quo?"

worldnews.3.d:0 "Since 1941 the North American continent has more closely resembled hell then anything built by Human hands. Today however, January 1st 1950, a glimmer of hope has arrived. A universal armistice dubbed colloquially as the "New Year's Peace" began its reign a few hours ago. It was birthed with the signing and ratification of the  "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostility and Exchange of Prisoners-of-War in the North American Continent."\n\nJournalists familiar with the conflict have been speculating on such an outcome for around a year. Their speculations were spurred on by a seemingly endless stalemate along the Eisenhower line, the daring destruction of the Trans-Canadian railway and the untimely passing of the constitutional president Jack Reed.\n\nWith the confirmation of these insights comes uncertainty; How long will such an armistice last?"

worldnews.4.d:0 "Micheal Collins,  President of the Irish Republic has passed away in Leinster House. According to his Widow Mrs Catherine Collins the cause was a heart attack amidst deteriorating health, which Mr Collins had kept hidden from the public at large.\n\nHis state funeral in Dublin was attended by an estimated 400,000 people, including many veterans from the war of independence with the absence of Ulster protestant TD's in protest of Collins role during the 1925 northern Campaign.\n\nAt the forefront of politics since the days of the war of independence, Collins legacy looms large, and it is doubtful if any one man could fill the void left behind by his absence. His unifying presence and guiding hand in its first decades ensured the young republic did not fall into factionalism. Even if many have accused him of using dictatorial and authoritarian methods to achieve such goals, few doubt his vision of neutrality in the world war and peaceful co-existence have been highly successful"

worldnews.7.d:0 "As the situation in the Balkans continues to spiral into what is being dubbed a "miniature world war" Moscow has grown anxious.High profile massacres and blatant disregard for the laws established in the 1946 treaty seems to have been the final straw for the hegemon.\n\nThis morning Russian troops entered Romanian territory en masse, to the shock of the world. Italian forces in Fiume have grown especially worried as the situation develops, mobilising their armed forces and warning local civilians to be ready for the worst. Marpac command in Paris has assumed PARDAN Three threat level, and we assume that much like the rest of the world, they wait with bated breath."

worldnews.8.d:0 "The world watched with awe as crippling revolts gripped almost every region in the Russian National State just weeks ago. The cause of such an event remains hotly debated, but the consequences have been clear.\n\nAfter restabilising and reasserting their control the Kremlin issued a dire warning to Paris. According to the Vohzd himself, the French goverment has been secretly supporting the activities of a terrorist milita known as the "Bolshevik Legion" in Ukraine. In response, Paris has done anything but back down. Aerial reconissance has confirmed the existence of a naval blockade on the edge of the Black Sea, and the Communard goverment has demanded it be allowed to extract "Aslyum seekers and French Nationals" from the region. It is unclear if such gunboat diplomacy will succeed. It seems that someone will have to blink first."

worldnews.9.d:0 "Occupation and hardship have characterised these last few years for the German citzenry. It was hoped that unification would provide ailment to the beleagured populace. Continued terrorist activity by the werewolves and feeble governance put an end to those hopes. Today may be considered their death knell.\n\nUnwilling to tolerate continued attacks on what they see as loyal citzens, and embolded by radical leadership, the Prussian Kingdom declared war on the German Republic today. This move was done in spite of threats from Moscow,  and the Prussian leadership justified their decision by asserting that as a soverign nation they are beholden only to themselves.\n\nThere can be no doubt that they have sense blood in the water and will attempt to reunite Germany. With neither Paris nor Moscow willing to tolerate the loss of their German buffer state, a wider war looms on the horizon."

worldnews.10.d:0 "Tragedys in the Alps this morning!\nReaders might recall the high profile crash and subesuequent capture of the secret British "R-1" spyplane last month by Russian authorities, which was said to be capable of flying at a staggering 70,000 feet.\n\nIn an event no doubt inspired by that incident, rogue elements of the Italian military opened fire on a Russian civilian airliner. Though they have claimed they did so in fear of retaliatory reconissance by the Russian goverment, it does not change the facts. There were no survivors among the wreckage, and the plane was obviously flying at a much lower altitude.\n\nOutrage has gripped the east, and the people have begun demanding blood. The goverment of Britain, France, and Italy have all offered condolensces and apologies to Russian authorities. Yet the Vohzd has claimed this is not enough, and is demanding the extradition of all personnel involved to Russia as well as monetary compensation. As of now, no response to said demands has been issued."

worldnews.11.d:0 ""Operation Free Africa", the MARPAC mission to liberate the dark continent took a disturbing turn today. Chemical weapons were deployed on the frontline miles outside of Leopoldville, though which side exactly deployed them is currently disputed.\n\n MARPAC officials in Algiers have condemned the cowardly decision and demanded yet again that Russia must withdraw its "Imperialist" support for their proxy forces in the region. In their statement, MARPAC also made clear that they would no longer discriminate when encountering combatants even if they happend to be Russian nationals. Moscow responded by accusing Paris of falsehood and treachery, and has gone as far as to claim that they are the "real imperialists" by continuing their agression against the native population. Moscow aditionally claimed it was only in the region to protect it's interests, though what interests it holds in the Congo remains to be seen."

Among those killed was a member of the French delegation,a Russian national, and a general of the Norwegian armed forces. The netural goverment of Norway has responded to the incident by ejecting all foreign officials from the country and ceasing negotiations.\n\nThe culprit remains at large accusations fly back and forth. The Kremlin is blaming NORGE, the republican faction that is linked to MARPAC and has participated in subterfuge in the past. Paris claims that Russia themselves staged the attacks to push negotiations in their favour, and that France would never attack civilian targets or kill one of their own.\n\n A state of emergency has descended on Norway, MARPAC has escalated to PARDAN Threat level three, and Russian troops have mobilised. It seems unlikely that war can be avoided. "
