Up for grabs is the chairmanship itself, alongside numerous minor posts and positions for representatives in the TUC.\n\nDespite calls for increased democracy intensifying and international condemnation of the Mosleyist administration building the prospects of change still seem doubtful. To international observers It matters little whether the English Socialists, Mosleyites, or National Labour candidates prevail. The Chairman’s grip seems to never wane. His clandestine influence is as thick as a suffocating cloud. It survives on backdoor schemes and  a powerful groundswell of patriotic support. Still, on the fringes of British society scattered student groups, regional union representatives, old fashioned politicians rally for change. Can the Black sheep of the socialist bloc overcome the repressive wartime status quo?"

A universal armistice dubbed colloquially as the "New Year's Peace" began its reign a few hours ago. It was birthed with the signing and ratification of the  "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostility and Exchange of Prisoners-of-War in the North American Continent."\n\nJournalists familiar with the conflict have been speculating on such an outcome for around a year. Their speculations were spurred on by a seemingly endless stalemate along the Eisenhower line, the daring destruction of the Trans-Canadian railway and the untimely passing of the constitutional president Jack Reed.\n\nWith the confirmation of these insights comes uncertainty; How long will such an armistice last?"

His unifying presence and guiding hand in its first decades ensured the young republic did not fall into factionalism. Even if many have accused him of using dictatorial and authoritarian methods to achieve such goals, few doubt his vision of neutrality in the world war and peaceful co-existence have been highly successful"

In response, Paris has done anything but back down. Aerial reconissance has confirmed the existence of a naval blockade on the edge of the Black Sea, and the Communard goverment has demanded it be allowed to extract "Aslyum seekers and French Nationals" from the region.

RN_intro_fra_1:0 "Stagnation and incoherence in the political direction of the new Republic following its creation in 1919 was still a plague upon the function of the State. However, unlike Britain that saw itself only reorganized in the aftermath of a life-or-death crisis, reforms in France took a more orthodox and democratic appearance.\n\nIt was with the landslide electoral victory of the Jacobinist faction, finally successful in deposing the stagnant syndicalist order in 1936, which would bring these reforms.\n\nPierre Semard was catapulted to head of state, and the series of reforms followed was known as the Year of Changes (Année des changements).\n\nThe opposition was powerful at first, but none could deny the disorder of the past, and it was eventually coaxed into a soft coalition. The absolute majority Jacobinists enjoyed in the BGT allowed them to swiftly enact their vision upon France, despite begrudging resistance of the Anarchist and the Radical Republican minority.\n\nThe French Federation as it was known in the years before was reformed into the French Social Republic, with the wholesale support of most spectrum of the left. This was excepted by the Anarchistes, who underwent a two-week abstention protest from the BGT. This lasted until they were promised concessions such as elected officers in the military (Which would be reversed half a year later in preparation for the war by the recommendations of the Committee of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.)\n\nThe new government realized that while understandable, the existing stigma against intelligence agencies was only harming the Republic. Therefore, meager existing intelligence structures would also be reorganised into the Bureau for the Suppression of Counter-Revolution and Sabotage or The Bureau. Despite the name, its chief concerns weren't the internal security of France, but an extensive scheme to spread the Revolution across the European continent. This was primarily conducted under the now-infamous secret Operation Lumière.\n\nHowever, while the industrialisation and rearmament plans, as well as the Bureau, were initially very successful, the reforms to the armed forces were not. French Popular Liberation Army itself was insufficient on its top leadership, and years of political bickering made truly extensive reform in the army delayed. it would not be until the last few years prior to the war that such an action would be achieved.\n\nEven then, many were overlapping or contradictory reforms, and severe lacks of capable officers in its ranks became a problem (due to their questionable loyalty and political leaning that saw most of those that stayed in France gradually released from the force which only intensified by the Gamelin Affairs.)\n\nWith the reforms in 1938, the Government tried to educate many of its revolutionary leaders during the civil war in military theory. However, with the war beginning only a year later, the problems of the officer corps were only acceptably resolved in 1941, after the French army's humiliating retreat from Belgium and forced memories of the first war digging themselves in to hold the German off French soils. A permanent divide between the army and the BGT developed."
RN_intro_eng_1:0 "From its conception in 1925 to the dawning days of 1936. The Union was always controlled by the former elements of the Labour Party and its associate groupings like the Independent Labour, the National Socialist, etc. Led by men like Phillip Snowden, whose vision of a revolution and socialism are limited to say the least, yet his position and his government is ever more precarious with the charge of treason hanging from the royalist and the charge of counter-revolutionary, a Kerensky of England as it was declared by the ever growing radical left from the opportunity and fervor after 1925.\n\nThe Snowden government pursuing a moderate Labourite path to sociaism eventually would come to a boiling point with those that violently oppose it. As such was the conspiracy of June 14th, 1936. Several Republican National Militias units, long a hotbed of radical with its lack of structure and command marched on the capital joining force with a large part of the union. However, R.E.D command also intercepted a conspiracy by the royalist elements in the military to use the opportunity to defend London to seize the Government and launch a counter-revolution. Thus calling the military to the defend of the Government seems almost implausible, but in this chaos, Secretary of Home Affair, Oswald Mosley would save the day after his speech to a large mass of strikers convinced them to turn back and cut the transportation of the Middlesex Regiment to prevent a counter-revolution. Then with his own volunteer militia - the Revolutionary Guards and the police, they barricaded the roads to the city blocking the rebellious militias. Delayed and disorganized, the rebel militia dispersed after loyal units from Wales can be recalled. While with the main royalist conspiracy force - the Middlesex Regiment stranded and eventually surrounded, its leadership gave up after news that the city is safe and calm.\n\nIn the aftermath of the two successive coup attempts, the Government of Phillip Snowden resigned. Triggering an election that Mosley easily sweap up with his popularity, charisma and more importantly the backing of the Labourite who saw him as the one capable to bring about a true English Socialism. Thus Mosley officially took office as the Chairman of the Union in the summer of 1937.\n\nThe Mosley Government quickly declared itself to full backing of the French-led revolutionary reforms. While strengthening the R.E.D, Mosley also got rid of elements dangerous to him by sending them to France to take part in Operation Lumire and the subsequent war as the Strategic Warfare Assistance Department, among these most notably would be the director T.E Lawrence himself.\n\nA new economic plan drafted by Mosley known as the Revolutionary Industrialisation Program aimed to solve the failing British industry following the lost of the capitalist market and a decade of shifting major focus to he Home Isles's agrarian problems. The plan also included the rearmament of Britain for the coming war and the defense of the Isles. The Republican Army was centralised and put directly under the Government and the incorporation of the new Department of Political Warfare, leading to the disbandment of all Republican National Militias in place of a new British Revolutionary Guards, thus eliminated most of the radical left's attempt as formenting independent military power."

However, by 1936 this unstable republic would suffer its final death blown with the world economic crisis of 1936 and the assasination of Aleksandr Kerensky, the deeply unpopular populist's death created a period of extreme chaos in the country owning not to anyone grieving the late president but the factional fighting of those who has longed for this day. With the country dying rapidly with a paralysed government, more than 30% of Russian would wake up with an empty belly and a lost job - mass suicide followed soon after. In this chaos however, one faction would ultimate win the day, later that year on March 21st, a secret conference in Saratov would be called for the right-wing parties and forces in Russia, its chairman is no other but the first soldier on the frontline against Bolshevism, Lavr Kornilov. Presided over a room of familiar faces, Boris Savinkov (NPPR), Pyotr Wrangel, Boris Brasol (representing on behalf of the Black-Hundredist Officer Union), Ivan Illyn and other people. There a common program was jointly signed titled “The Rebirth of Russia”. Two weeks later from the secret conference, the assassination of its Mayor shocked Moscow, as the second most high profile death in city from assasination, however, more threatening than the death of poor Fyodorovich, this death was publicly taken responsibility by a certain Bolshevik combat group that styled itself the “Lenin’s Young Chekists” and was wholeheartedly cheered on by the RFSSR  Government-in-exiles in Paris, but later investigation conducted by French Bureau revealed suspicion about the existent of such entity and its relationship with the Bolshevik Underground. Regardless, the investigation by the Okhrana was quickly suspended, and the case forgotten with the event happening 2 days after it. On April 6, 1938, the streets of Moscow were packed with a large entourage of officers, military and police decorated and lined up to form a direct path to the Duma Building. Wearing his old Civil War uniforms, with flowers thrown upon, Lavr Kornilov entered the Duma in a reminiscent of the old day before the Reds Rebellion. A document was presented to the Duma, on its cover “Resolutions of the 16th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)”, it presented a conspiracy about the alliance and reconciliation with the “Democratic” and “Progressive” forces of Russia named directly as the Mensheviks and the SRs in an effort to topple the weakened reactionary regime as its weakest to proclaim a new Socialist Soviet Republic. With that the Duma is henceforth disbanded, to be replaced by a Government of National Salvation. And in his first decrees, as the last president of the Republic, to dissolve it, and to outlaw both the Mensheviks and the SRs to form the Russian National State and declared himself the Vozhd of All-Russia.\n\nReactions to the implementation of the April Decrees were hostile as first, especially by its victims with the SRs returning to terrorism and claimed the life of hundreds in the Year of Sulfur, most notably Denikin and Savinkov. But peace and stability returned to Russia in the end, with the series of governmental reforms, agrarian reforms and industrialisation no longer hindered by parties politics and assisted by the broad of capable ideologues and intellectuals in the time known as the Kornilov Years. This also formed the foundation of the  Five-Headed Regime that continued to govern Russia.\n\nKornilov passed away from a heart attack on April 7th, 1948. 2 years after his holy duty to Russia is finished and a new world order in which Russia is a pillar is established. But under the shadow of Kornilov's lavish funeral march across Moscow, his pupils plot. The power struggle between the factions of the Regime and within the Kornilovites themselves only ended 3 months after his death, with Wrangel, Kutepov and various old guards forced into "retirement" while a large numbers of Black Hundreds and Savinkovists setenced to death for treason in the Petrogard show trials. The young faction of Kornilovites emerged as absolute victor and its face are the two duo, Nikolai Skoblin - the Vozhd of Russia and Mikhail Levitov - The Marshal of Prussia.\n\n"

Rommel has just been promoted to Field Marshal expecting that he would defend to his death the city of Berlin while the government and refugees evacuate to Switzerland. As the battle of Berlin beginning its first shots. Admiral Karl von Doenitz, new interim Head of the Navy after his predecessor was killed by a car bomb by a French Bureau operative, the Navy itself for the last 2 years of the war also occupied itself with land combat to slow the Russian and French advance along the coast under constant threat of Treaty Airforces. Doenitz presented to the new Kaiser one simple option on the war prospect: Either the Russian or nothing under the Reds. Soon a secret conference were called, Moscow received a memo stamped with the Kaiserreich emblem and the Russian Army marched through East Prussia virtually unopposed. This endevour proved to be worthwhile with the Russian Army arriving on the outskirt of Berlin, now surrendered and halted the Reds advance.\n\nHowever, despite strong protest and some case even violently as the Russian insisted on a military government in Prussia, it was imposed regardless as the Russian fears the territorial redistribution in the aftermath of the war between their allies could cause unessesary conflict and resistant if the Prussian Government remains autonomous. By 1950, the health of Wilhelm III deteriorated due to the wound he received during the Rhineland Campaign by a RAF raid. Admiral Karl von Doenitz was made Regent and Chancellor of the interim provisional government until Prussian sovereignty can be reasserted."

RN_intro_pardan:0 "During PARDAN 1, the nuclear war will take the shape of a limited nuclear exchange.Only a small number of warheads will be allowed for the player to use during this phase. These warheads would be delivered via strategic bombers using the vanilla nuke system. However, we have made some changes to the damage of these vanilla nukes. In essence, the vanilla system still exists but has been revamped.\n\nRegular nukes now destroy any and all army units stationed where they explode..Regular nukes will also create a temporarily impassable zone, representing the initial nuclear shock. These zones will be cleared after a few days. This mechanic will force you to be considerate when nuking the frontline, lest you accidentally wipe out your army alongside the enemy. Nukes are not toys! They are however a great tool to stop enemy offensives and destroy their units if you have troops to spare. Remember that the nuclear shock is also a window of opportunity to fill holes, so it won’t be a one-way street.\n\nPARDAN 0 is the endgame.\n\nAll restrictions on nuclear weapons are lifted at this stage, first for the losing faction and next for the winning one. You will gain access to the entire national stockpile and to the ICBM and salvo attack decision panel. The ICBM panel will provide you with a list of targets that you can launch devastating salvo attacks on. However, to initiate such a launch the player must complete a complicated procedure.\n\nFor balance purposes, you need to repeat the launch procedure before each ICBM salvo attack. During this critical phrase all bets are off. The enemy will be forced into a desperate slog, and must rush to capture your headquarters as fast as possible before the nuclear devastation is unsalvageable. Remember that while the winning faction has delayed access to the salvo attacks, they will retaliate as well, so it's a gamble you as the player must take.\n\nSome additional notes regarding salvo attacks. ICBMs are a resource and should be considered precious. Each attack will consume a number of nukes from your available stockpile. Also, a salvo attack will render the damaged area permanently destroyed and unusable due to the more destructive payload.. The impasse will never clear, as it represents a high concentration of nuclear fallout as opposed to a single tactical detonation.\n\nFinally, sometimes the ICBM attack might fail to destroy the targeted enemy city. In such a case the player is allowed to attack said location in the next launch cycle. With another strike you may knock it down for good."
