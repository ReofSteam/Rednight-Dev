POLITICS_TIM_BUCK_DESC:0 "Tim Buck, a machinist and trade unionist, rose through the ranks of the Communist Party early on in the party's history. Even before the British Revolution, he was a staunch supporter of the notion that the Canadian nation must work to liberate itself from both British and American domination. The flight of the British elites to Canada, and the resulting economic woes and state repression, only confirmed this belief. This position, despite its rejection by the majority of the party's leadership, proved popular among anglophone party members especially, among whom he became a popular figure. However, after he sided with the Travailleurs in France's 1936 factional struggle, the rest of the leadership, which had sided with the Jacobins and Syndicalist-Revolutionaries, began to marginalise him. \n\nHe was one of the first Communists to declare that the 1940 Canadian Revolution was not only a class war, but a war of national liberation. Since then, as the majority of the party began advocating for a union between the Canadian and American peoples in a single socialist republic, Buck led a split from the CPC and formed the Movement for an Independent Socialist Canada. He was followed not only by other Communists, but also a part of the CCF, for whom the struggle for Canadian independence has taken on a primary importance. He has also begun advocating for a more aggressive policy towards independent Quebec and Newfoundland."
POLITICS_MAURICE_SPECTOR_DESC:0 "Maurice Spector was perhaps Canada's first Communist theorist. An early leader in the party, alongside Jack MacDonald and William Moriarty, he was the obvious choice for party leader after their deaths. Spector played a key role in marginalising Tim Buck for his Canadian nationalist and pro-Travailleur positions, and as a result Buck has refused all attempts at reconciliation since his split from the party. \n\nWith the remainder of the party united behind Spector's leadership, the Communist Party is expected to make moves towards Canada's integration with the Commonwealth of America. Under his leadership the CPC has also begun advocating for a moderation of relations with Quebec and Newfoundland, although they've stopped short of advocating full recognition."
POLITICS_TOMMY_DOUGLAS_DESC:0 "Tommy Douglas is a popular figure in the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which aims to unite the labour and farmers' movements. At the beginning of the Revolution, the party was thrown into a crisis, as the majority of the party was opposed to armed revolt against the state, but they couldn't bring themselves to condemn the strikes that had led to insurrection. The Communist Party was thus able to take leadership of the Revolution. Later that year, in the midst of civil war, the leader of the CCF, JS Woodsworth, fell victim to a stroke. This was the height of the party's crisis, and a factional struggle ensued between Douglas on the left and Major James Coldwell on the right. Douglas emerged victorious, and immediately approached the Communists to propose a united front. \n\nDouglas and Spector, the CPC's leader, have worked closely together to rebuild Canada as a socialist commonwealth, but divisions have emerged. The CCF has taken an official line that Canada should either retain its independence or be granted a special autonomous status within the Commonwealth of America, as opposed to the CPC's advocacy for full integration. Additionally, the CCF defends the property rights of farmers, and advocates for full recognition of independent Quebec and Newfoundland."
