SUL.0.t:0 "The Governorate of Sulawesi"
SUL.0.d:0 "When Insulindia was officially declared independent, Dr. Sam Ratulangi was sent to Sulawesi to govern it in the name of the central government. When he arrived, he found an island full of various groups vying for influence, with most of the land devastated by war and any fertile land having little to none development. \n\nRatulangi's problems start with the land. Most of the farm had been looted by Westerling. Any farms Westerling thinks to have sheltered Republicans he burned, looted, and salted. And the problems doesn't stop with just the land. Westerling's old opponents, the APRIS, the freedom fighters of Sulawesi, has now fractured into two factions. One in the north, mostly filled by guerillas of Ratulangi's ethnicity, led by Wolter Mongisidi, a chivalrous young man with a great reputation. Meanwhile in the south, in the provincial capital of Makassar, the militias led by the young and ambitious Andi Azis, who contends with the north at every turn. \n\nWith great vigour and effort, Ratulangi united the various squabbling groups of Sulawesi. He built road networks and performed land reforms, and the smallfolk of Sulawesi are able to live well.."
SUL.0.a:0 "Good times ahead, no?"

SUL.1.t:0 "The Final Days..."
SUL.1.d:0 "Most of Sulawesi's fortunes relied on Ratulangi. But no one, even Ratulangi himself, had thought of a Sulawesi without Ratulangi. He seems to be constantly ill, and many said that it is unlikely for him to make it halfway through the year. \n\nWhile Ratulangi's second in command, Lapian has proved to be a capable leader, but will his work be of the same calibre as Ratulangi's? \n\nEither way, Ratulangi seems determined to do his all in his last days..."
SUL.1.a:0 "This will be his last stand, then."

SUL.2.t:0 "One Last Push"
SUL.2.d:0 "Ratulangi's health has steadily declined, and it is unlikely that he may govern the province for more than a couple months. A couple months is enough time for us to focus on one pressing matter, but not all of them. What should we focus on?."
SUL.2.a:0 "We must focus on welfare!"
SUL.2.b:0 "We must focus on politics!"
SUL.2.c:0 "We must focus on security!"

SUL.3.t:0 "A Lunch in Makassar"
SUL.3.d:0 "As the figure stands, all eyes are fixed on him and an old man, sitting by the window. The figure is Andi Azis, in full military attire. He handshakes the old man, and leaves after saluting, with a concerned look visible in his face. \n\nRatulangi had just met Andi Azis, his face looks tired, but also relieved as he had just established an agreement with Andi Azis after long talks. During said talks, Ratulangi leveraged the fact that Andi Azis craved formal recognition from the central government for his service. The lack of recognition of his army's services has made him disgruntled and distrustful of Djakarta. That seems to be the biggest thing that Andi Azis wanted. After many promises and table-banging, Andi Azis finally promises to forgo all his grudges with Mongisidi and work for the good of the province if Ratulangi dies. \n\nAs he leaves, Andi Azis is asked by a subordinate, 'Why the look, Colonel?', After a long pause, Andi Azis answered,'He is truly nearing his end', he said."
SUL.3.a:0 "One less threat to the establishment."

SUL.4.t:0 "Homecoming"
SUL.4.d:0 "Ratulangi travelled to his homeland in Tondano, North Sulawesi. He was greeted by dozens of guerillas surrounding his home. Mongisidi arrived and shook his hand and bowed respectfully like a grandchild to his grandfather. \n\nFor two long hours, they sat down inside the house talking. They talked about Ratulangi's struggles in the days of the Budi Utomo. Ratulangi tells stories of how he had witnessed the revolt of the gallant Ranggong Daeng Romo, a mentor of Monginsidi. Ratulangi also told many tales of the heroic struggles of their people, the Minahasa. In the end of each of his story, Ratulangi carefully added about how his health isn't like how it used to, which must've provoked a small bit of pity in the heart of Monginsidi, who also heard all his stories with awe.  \n\nBut after two long hours, the peace broke when Ratulangi suddenly had a stroke. Monginsidi called for a doctor multiple times, and to a fainting Ratulangi, Monginsidi swore that he would work together with Andi Azis if necessary for the good of the province should Ratulangi die. This calmed the old man, and although the stroke is definitely real, it somehow looks like it had planned all along..."
SUL.4.a:0 "No place like home.."

SUL.5.t:0 "Watampone"
SUL.5.d:0 "Finally, Andi Azis has been dealt with, but South Sulawesi isn't secure yet. In the city of Watampone sits Andi Mappanyukki, the Sultan of Gowa and Bone. The northern guerillas and the southern militias had often clashed in his lands, so to preserve the peace, Andi Mappanyukki decided to raise a militia army, an action that provoked outcry from every member of the Sulawesi political system. \n\nThankfully, we have successfully negotiated to the disbandment of most of the militia, after long talks and many promises made. This will decrease the amount of problems that Sulawesi will face in the future. "
SUL.5.a:0 "Fewer problems, thank god!"

SUL.6.t:0 "Palopo"
SUL.6.d:0 "Andi Djemma, Sultan of Luwu rules in Palopo. he rules a relatively vast land, with the Darul Islam bandits on one side, and multiple cliques of robber barons reside illegally, awaiting justice. Because of this, the Sultan of Luwu, Andi Djemma recruited and maintained a militia army. \n\nDjemma maintained that he would need those militia to preserve law and order in his lands. So Ratulangi offers a deal. His goverment would take charge of the militias and defend his territory from any problem, and that it would take care of the robber barons soon. \n\nThis deal obviously is tipped towards Ratulangi, and he wonders why Djemma would agree to the deal. Was it loyalty? Was it finances? or is this a part of a plan all along..?"
SUL.6.a:0 "A reasonable man, i suppose.."

SUL.7.t:0 "The Death of Ratulangi"
SUL.7.d:0 "While delivering a speech, Ratulangi had a visible heart attack. He clutched his chest in a moment as the entire crowd gasps and rushes to the podium to help him, but antonishingly, Ratulangi stood calm and continued the speech for 3 minutes and 11 seconds, until he finished the speech and collapsed head-first to the ground. \n\nHe was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital and was immediately operated upon. The news immediately spread around the isle. As tribal chiefs slaughtering their livestock as sacrifice to hopefully save Ratulangi's live, Christians, Muslims, Hindu and others alike pray for Ratulangi's safe recovery. All of Sulawesi held their breath, waiting and praying for news of Ratulangi's safe recovery. \n\nUnfortunately, God was impatient to see the great man himself. Ratulangi died at 18.34 PM. The Governor is dead."
SUL.7.a:0 "Sic transit gloria mundi."

SUL.8.t:0 "The Death of Ratulangi"
SUL.8.d:0 "Ratulangi had just visited a dinner reception with one of the key industrialisers along with a couple of advisors and friends. He looked fine and healthy, dancing and laughing as if he was never sick at all, which baffled everyone. One Javanese advisor told his friend jokingly that 'There is an old Javanese saying that when a sick man appears healthy, it must be that his death is very close.' \n\nHe would prove right. The dinner would be the last hurrah for Ratulangi, and the last time anyone would see him alive.\n\nThe next morning, Ratulangi's daughter Uki, would discover that the old man had died, the reaper harvesting his soul in his sleep. It seems that he had died peacefully, and heavens know what was his last words was. Farewell, governor."
SUL.8.a:0 "A peaceful ending for a man."

SUL.9.t:0 "The Death of Ratulangi"
SUL.9.d:0 "While adressing the APRIS about the Kahar Muzakkar situation, Ratulangi had a stroke. He clutched his chest in a moment as generals rush to the podium to help him, but Ratulangi immediately collapsed head-first to the ground before anyone could help him. \n\nHe was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital and was immediately operated upon. The generals kept the news secret as they fear Kahar Muzakkar and his pacified brigade would rise and return to rampage Sulawesi Tenggara. Wilhelm Lapian was sworn in as the acting governor the next hour until hopefully, Ratulangi recovers.\n\nRatulangi would wake up again at 16.34 PM, but only to say his final words, which are 'Mijn God, erbarm u over mij en over uw arme volk', quoting William van Oranje's last words. Exactly at 19.00 PM, Lapian announced to the people that Ratulangi had died."
SUL.9.a:0 "The Governor is dead, long live the Governor."

SUL.10.t:0 "The Funeral of Samuel Ratulangi"
SUL.10.d_war:0 "Samuel Ratulangi has finally rested. Today, hundred of thousands had crowded the streets of Makassar to mourn their beloved governor. \n\nSamuel Ratulangi has had a very eventful life, full of struggles, successes and failures. He had transformed Sulawesi from a desolate and burning province into one of the most prosperous province in Insulindia. In his final days, Ratulangi had focused on cracking down on the Darul Islam and Kahar Muzakkar, and the Herculean task costed him his life. Whether or not his efforts are in vain, it is too early to tell. \n\nDignitaries had arrived from every corner of the province and the Republic. Bernard Wilhelm Lapian gave the eulogy before them. After that, the Vice-President of Insulindia, Mohammad Hatta adressed the dignitaries and praised Ratulangi's life as 'The life of a true hero'. Present in the crowds are Aceh's Achmad Soebardjo, Kalimantan's Prince Adipati of Pontianak, Bali's Tjokorda Gde Sukawati Raka, and a long time friend of Ratulangi, Sosro Kartono. \n\nAn interesting sight as well was Andi Azis and Wolter Mongisidi sitting next to each other in the front row, talking like friends. Many wondered why are they suddenly shedding their hostilities. Was it out of respect of Ratulangi, or was it a calm before a very violent storm?"

SUL.10.a:0 "Farewell, Ratulangi."

SUL.11.t:0 "The Devil in White"
SUL.11.d:0 "Two weeks has passed after the funeral of Samuel Ratulangi, Andi Azis received a secret telegram from one of his contacts. It was Chris Soumokil, an influential man in the politics of the Dutch remnants in Papua and Mollucas. \n\nAndi Azis and Soumokil had been in contact for a long time. Andi Azis regards Soumokil as a spy and informant in the Dutch lands to the east. All he knows is that Soumokil had a very reliable spy network that stretches from Atjeh to Papua, and that Soumokil is interested in maintaining Insulindian independence and the status quo. Soumokil too had helped Andi Azis in many things, such as getting rid of the Darul Islamist, Kahar Muzakkar. \n\nWhat he doesn't know, is that Soumokil is a manipulator who tries to sow as much chaos in Insulindia for an unknown goal. He had Kahar Muzakkar disgraced to cause a Darul Islam uprising in Sulawesi. He had also caused the tension between Mongisidi and Andi Azis to escalate from rivalry to contention. Soumokil is indeed a crafty and utterly dangerous man. \n\nThe telegram's contents are unknown, but Andi Azis immediately travelled to Buton island in Southeast Sulawesi."
SUL.11.a:0 "Better the devil you know.."

SUL.12.t:0 "A Meeting in Buton"
SUL.12.d:0 "Andi Azis arrived in Buton and met Soumokil in a local warung. The atmosphere was somewhat tense, as the most dangerous man in Sulawesi meets the most dangerous man in eastern Insulindia. They both ordered a cup of black coffee and began to talk. \n\nSoumokil told Andi Azis about a debate in the parliament of Insulindia. There were talks about centralisation, spearheaded by the prime minister himself, Mohammad Natsir. Mohammad Natsir thought that the only way to keep the Republic united is to centralise it, curbing the powers of the provincial governors and adding them to the Central Government's ever-increasing gauntlet of power. \n\nSoumokil warned that this action would only cause chaos in Sulawesi, and tells Andi Azis that if he wants to keep Ratulangi's legacy alive, he should oppose this decision. After telling that, Soumokil says goodbye and leaves, leaving Andi Azis alone with his cup of black coffee."
SUL.12.a:0 "Should i be worried?"

SUL.13.t:0 "A Difficult Choice"
SUL.13.d:0 "Obey or Rebel, those were the choices Andi Azis have. \n\nObey, sit still and wait for the parliament, which would be the most natural and logical choice. After all, it's not like Natsir can control the mind of the 120 members of the parliament. But if the motion passes, then it would seem that all the work Ratulangi has done would go into the ground, and there would be nothing Andi Azis can do to stop it. \n\nor Rebel, and risk betraying Ratulangi's legacy himself. Indeed it is a very hard choice and the least logical choice, but doing that would allow Andi Azis to do all actions that he deems necessary to protect Ratulangi’s legacy. \n\nBut after long hours of thinking, Andi Azis has finally made a decision..."
SUL.13.a:0 "The hardest choices require the strongest of wills"

SUL.14.t:0 "Andi Azis' Coup"
SUL.14.d:0 "Lapian had just left for Djakarta to be sworn in as the new governor of Sulawesi. Andi Azis was given mandate to hold the fort until Lapian returns. Andi Azis decided that it's now or never, he and is co-conspirators would take over the Government now. \n\nAs the APRIS takes over key positions in Makassar, Palu and Poso, Andi Azis emerges and announces to the people of Sulawesi that he and the military had taken over the government. The uproar was incredible. Within 30 minutes, a message arrived from Mongisidi berating and denouncing him. But between Makassar and Manado, there was complete silence as the Sultans and Datus bided their time, and wait for the situation go better. \n\nOvernight, the political system of Sulawesi was reformed, and many actions was made by Andi Azis to consolidate his power. But so far, no responses at all from the Central Government."
SUL.14.a:0 "May God and Ratulangi forgive us!"

SUL.15.t:0 "The Red Dossier"
SUL.15.d:0 "Five days ago, a document arrived from Djakarta. It bears the formal response of the Central Government on our coup of the provincial government. \n\nThe document demands the surrender of Andi Azis, and also all apparatus of provincial government back to the Central Government within at the latest, five days. The document also promises retaliation by military action if we refuse. This was an unprecedentedly aggressive response from Soekarno. \n\nA letter also came in from behind it. It was a private letter from Prime Minister Natsir, inviting Andi Azis to Djakarta to bring his case before the Parliament, in exchange for surrender. An unnecessary and impossible offer indeed.  \n\nNow, military forces have landed in Madjane, Mamudju and Pasangkaju. Bolstered by Lady Andi Opu, they face no resistance and will pose as a strong base from with the Central Government is free to launch retaliatory military expeditions."
SUL.15.a:0 "God, what have we done"

SUL.16.t:0 "Luwu Defects!"
SUL.16.d:0 "Earlier this afternoon, the Datu of Luwu had announced that he will militarily support the Central Government's campaign in Sulawesi. He immediately mustered up his militia divisions and attacked the city of Watampone. It only took three hours and the unprepared and baffled city garrison surrendered."
SUL.16.a:0 "Traitor!"

SUL.18.t:0 "The Defeat of the Central Government"
SUL.18.d:0 "The Central Government has been repelled from their last bases in the islands of Sulawesi. As the enemy leaves the island of Sulawesi, so too Lady Andi Opu and Datu Andi Djemma. This was an upset victory, with unknown consequences.  \n\nThe entire APRIS sprung into a celebration, as they, like Daud in the tales of yore, had defeated Jalut with the weapon they had. Euphoria spread along all of South Sulawesi, while the North remains silent, unresponsive and neutral as they always have. Eerily as well, the Hasanuddin Brigade also mysteriously disappeared without any news, either because they are afraid of our new strength, or they are waiting for their next move.  \n\nAndi Azis finds the Governor’s palace full of celebrating official, the smell of cigarettes filling the building. As he enters his office, he wonders…"
SUL.18.a:0 "How the hell did we just do that?"

SUL.31.t:0 "Battle of Watampone"
SUL.31.d:0 "Mongisidi led his guerillas on a southwards march towards Makassar. They have advanced steadily and silently, as Andi Azis’s gaze seems to be elsewhere. The guerillas have the element of surprise and a righteous cause behind them. By now, they had reached the outskirts of Watampone. \n\nAndi Azis led his army personally in a forced march northwards. This will be his final showdown with Mongisidi. \n\nAndi Azis found Watampone an empty ruin. He decided to create a command centre in the Royal Palace of Gowa, or at least whatever that remained of it. As his soldiers rest and screen the city for any potential survivors, Mongisidi’s guerilla appeared out of nowhere. After a brief and massive battle, it was clear that Andi Azis was on the losing side. His command centre was surrounded, and after an hourlong gunfight, Andi Azis has run out of ammunition and decided to surrender. He is currently under Mongisidi’s custody and awaiting trial, unharmed but defeated."
SUL.31.a:0 "A new order."

SUL.32.t:0 "Waterloo for Mongisidi"
SUL.32.d:0 "Mongisidi led his guerillas on a southwards march towards Makassar. They have advanced steadily and silently, as Andi Azis’s gaze seems to be elsewhere. The guerillas have the element of surprise and a righteous cause behind them. By now, they had reached the outskirts of Watampone. \n\nAndi Azis led his army personally in a forced march northwards. This will be his final showdown with Mongisidi. \n\nThe guerillas had the element of surprise, they thought. But Andi Azis isn’t dubbed the ‘Kancil’ for nothing. Mongisidi had walked into a trap along with all his guerillas. It was a short but bloody carnage when Andi Azis and his main army arrived, but the garrison is still holding out, along with the newest weaponry and artillery. Mongisidi surrendered with the condition that no more of his men are harmed. Andi Azis accepted and brought Mongisidi to Makassar, where he promises no harm will come to him."
SUL.32.a:0 "We are not friends, but neither are we enemies.."

SUL.51.t:0 "Darul Islam Takeover!"
SUL.51.d:0 "Chaos erupted in Makassar as the Brigade Hasanuddin suddenly and unexpectedly stormed the capital. It was a coordinated effort, and the fact that they had managed to strike out of nowhere has inflicted panic on not only the populace but the Military as well. \n\nThe Brigade has been consolidating power ever since the Central Government invaded the Island. They had gathered discontents from all around Sulawesi, even converts from the Minahasa lands to the north. They are now ready to attack the capital in a sudden, and deadly strike. \n\nAndi Azis was walking home from the mosque after the Ashar prayers until suddenly, three unknown men grabbed him out of nowhere and tried to kidnap him. He resisted and later summarily gunned down. After the Brigade controlled the town, Kahar Muzakkar appeared and claimed the government. He pledged allegiance to the Darul Islam."
SUL.51.a:0 "A new order."

His Brigade was crushed easily, and more men surrendered than died, their religious zeal and longing for Paradise vanished without a trace. \n\nKahar Muzakkar’s dead body was found crushed by an ancient cannon in the Sumba Opu fort. A humiliating death for sure, for the Wali of Sulawesi."

SUL.91.d:0 "The literacy programmes that Ratulangi has began last year has come into fruition. Miraculously, despite the chaos of war, the programmes had continued without any interruptions whatsoever, and the programmes had intensified after Ratulangi's death, which may have inspired the teachers who worked in these programmes. Now, over 60 percent of Sulawesi's populace is literate, which is an incredible result."
