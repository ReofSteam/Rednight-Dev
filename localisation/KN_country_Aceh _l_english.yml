ACH.1.t:0 "Under the Moonlight"
ACH.1.d:0 "It was still dark when the letter came, and Hasan had just finished his Tahajjud prayers. While doing the dzikir, an adjutant came with the letter and left Hasan to read the letter alone in the dim-lighted room. Hasan had to check the letter’s contents a couple of times, as his eyes cannot believe what it’s contents are. \n\nThe letter contains a new series of dictates from Djakarta, despite the fact that all the governors and residents in the Republic must’ve also received the same letter, he felt that the letter was personally directed towards him. Djakarta had noticed his power and decided to curb it all from him. He might lose his job or even all the work he has done. \n\nHe ends the letter with a sigh and decides to ask for a cup of tea. While drinking the tea, he chose to think that perhaps this Integral Motion is merely a reform, and not complete restructuring. Perhaps he can still do good for his home. “Today is going to be a long day”, he thought."
ACH.1.a:0 "Bismillah."

ACH.2.t:0 "Good Intentions"
ACH.2.d:0 "Daud received the letter after he had finished his Subuh prayers. After he finished all the do’as and dzikirs, a young boy gave him a letter. The boy told him that it was from Banda Atjeh. The letter had a presidential seal, and then the Resident’s personal seal. He retired to his personal chambers to read the letter. \n\nHe read the letter from top to bottom, trembling with anger as he continues to read it. In the end is a note, personally scribbled by Hasan, saying “Brother, what do you think?”. Daud knows that Hasan is cannot possibly resist these dictates, not without pitting Atjeh against other Muslim brothers, the same ones that had been at Atjeh’s side when they expelled the Dutch. \n\nAs Hasan is trapped in a dilemma, Daud too would feel the dilemma. Obey and be subjugated, or Resist and fight the colossus? \n\nThe man behind this letter too had fought alongside him.  He definitely sends this letter with good intentions, after all, “Pak Natsir knows best.” Daud couldn’t possibly hate the man, who he knows is wise and virtuous and is only doing what he thinks is right for the country. \n\nIn the end, Daud had made a choice. Daud left his chambers with his finest clothes and peci. He would gather the ulema."
ACH.2.a:0 "Audzubillah."

ACH.3.t:0 "The Integral Motion"
ACH.3.d:0 "Daud the Guerilla and Hasan the Resident has met in Lhokseumawe. They may be rivals, but that didn’t stop them from dining and drinking coffee together. Both continue to talk about a lot of things, none of them is about official matters. They are both trying to avoid talking about the sensitive topic of the Integral Motion. \n\nBut then, an adjutant of Hasan brought up the topic. Both sighed, and Hasan visibly facepalmed. They argued and argued and argued until it was Zuhur time. They prayed together, with Daud as the imam, and when it would seem that they are no longer arguing, they hilariously continued to bicker. Two hours later, they would depart to their power base. \n\nBut as both of them left, the question remains. How will Atjeh react to the Motion?"
ACH.3.a:0 "We follow Djakarta!"
ACH.3.b:0 "We resist Djakarta!"

But now, they are rivals and they both struggle for power within the province. \n\nMohammad Hasan draws support from the urban-dwellers and represents the secular and modern part of Aceh, while Daud Bereueh draws support from the isolated rural population, and represents the religious and traditional part of Aceh. \n\n[ACH_leader]"

POLITICS_MUHHASAN_DESC:0 "Teuku Mohamad Hasan was born to an aristocratic family in Pidie. His father was Teuku Bintara Ibrahim, who was the local Uleebalang of the area. He enjoyed good education at the hands of the Dutch and even went to Leiden University, where he met nationalists such as Hatta and Ali. \n\nIn 1933, Meester in de Rechten Teuku Mohammad Hasan returned to Atjeh. When he landed, he was immediately subjected to a search, which led to the confiscation of his books. The Dutch considered him as a threat to the local authorities, and his books dangerous it’s contents are taught to the local populace. \n\nHe then joined the Muhammadiyyah, and during the first national uprising, he was not involved at all, as he was busy building and opening schools, quadrupling the number of schools in Atjeh by 1942, when the Laskar Hizbullah was founded. He joined the Laskar Hizbullah, as it was organized by the Muhammadiyyah and NU to fight against the Dutch oppressors, climbing its ranks and gaining the nickname “the Teacher”. \n\nAfter a failed uprising by the Hizbullah, the organisation splintered into two, one led by Hasan himself, and the other led by Tengku Mohammad Daud, a renowned cleric, whose friendliness and wisdom earned him the nickname “the Father”. Both would become long-time rivals, made worse when Hasan was offered the Governorship of the entire island of Sumatra. \n\nHasan refused that offer, preferring to focus on improving his homelands of Atjeh and to protect it from the rise of Socialism in Bharat and RMK, which are literally on Atjeh’s doorsteps. From there he had created a very rich and autonomous residency, that would provoke the jealousy of Djakarta.  How this jealousy would rear its head, only Allah knows."
