WPL_unfaithful_alliances:0 "Unfaithful Alliances"
WPL_unfaithful_alliances_desc:0 "While binded to it because of the red menace, Poland has always distrusted the countries of the SARPAC.

##Leader Descriptions##

POLITICS_TADEUSZ_BIELECKI_DESC:0 "Tadeusz Bielecki studied and graduated in Polish Literature and Philology in Krakow. After the establishment of the Kingdom of Poland he participated in a series of right wing parties and organisations, eventually joining the Polish Radical Front. Between 1936 and 1944, he headed the front in its underground resistance against the Kingdom of Poland, a satellite of Germany in all but name. During this time, Bielecki developed his anti-german right wing nationalist views and was influenced by his anti-semitic colleagues. He also started favouring a corporatist state over Roman Ribarski's mainstream liberal visions. In 1944, when the National Party declared the Republic of Poland in order to fight the puppet king, the National Radical Camp joined their lines and after Wladyslaw Sikorski's death in the nuking of Warsaw, Bielecki was declared president, due to his popularity all over the country. The united nationalist forces eventually beat back the Germans, with help from the Russian Army, and annexed their rightful territories in Masuria, Gdansk and Poznan. Thadeusz Bielecki was the first eastern leader to denounce the leftist powers of Western Europe as illegitimate and unmoral, citing their illegal occupation of Czechia and the lands of the South Slavs. Since then the president has quarreled with Roman Ribarski and the National Party, over economic and social policies and it seems the uneasy coalition between the two nationalist political organisations is at an end, only being kept through the mediation of Savinkov."
