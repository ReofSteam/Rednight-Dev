PNG_Professional_Administration_desc:0 "Despite his origins as a civilian called up by the military, Governor Lyon's rule is quite competent. The ports bustle, the streets remain crime free, and the opposing forces live in harmony. The people may not enjoy unlimited freedom, but the goverment's guiding hand has ensured smooth sailing all things considered."

POLITICS_HUGH_LYON_DESC: "Hugh Lyon is a conductor, and post-war New Guinea is his chaotic orchestra. From his past long past as a settler himself and a pilot, he has grown into colonial administrator. His job is a great balancing act between the interests of rowdy natives, paranoid Anglos, and homesick German settlers. Thankfully, all sides have grown to respect Hugh as a charismatic father figure. Under his administration, the mandate has managed to preserve the rule of law without much bloodshed. While he has been forced to take authoritarian measures in pursuit of such a status quo, the mandate at least seems fair. None are immune to punishment, and none are free from concession."
