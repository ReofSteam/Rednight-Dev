While Romania is the dominat millitary power in the Balkan, thanks to its victory in the Fourth Balkan War and the Second Weltkreig, and under the singular control of the Iron Guard. There are cracks appearing in Romania's unity. King Michael sturggles againist the restriction places on the Monarchy places by the Consistitution of 1942 and wartime powers given to Prime Minister Codreanu. Some in the Iron Guard see the restriction of the Romanian Monarchy by Codreanu as a betrayel of the Iron Guard Ideals. Other in the Guard view the increasing poltical power of the Romanian Orthodox Church as preventing Romanian from becoming a modren nation. In truth, Romania while appearing to be unified is a nation about to explode into poltical chaos. The question is what will be the spark ? Will it be the incresing ties with Russia, the fate of confiscated land, or somthing else ?"

With the young Micheal on the throne, Prime Minister Codreanu declared that a new constution should be created to prevent a repeat of the nobility undercutting the power of the Parliment that occured under Carol II. This new constution was quickly created and ratified, some say too quickly. The new consitution not only cut the poltical power of the Romanian nobility, but also render the king pretty much poltically powerless. The Constutition also banned all non-Iron Guard Parties, create a new regional goverment between the Judet goverment and the national, and allow the Prime Minister to take on emergency wartime powers. While the Constitution was intial unversially recevied by the Iron Guard leadership, opinon of some have shifted to viewing the constitution as a naked power grab by Codreanu."

While these factions at the moment can agreed on the issues that the Romanian government should dealt, they cannot agreed on the exact path. This divide, however, appear to be growing due to disagreement over Romania place in the SARPAC that might lead to potential problems for Romania down the line.""

During his teen years, Micheal began to be courted by the Iron Guard into supporting their causes. While Micheal did not support every aspect of the Iron Guard, he did agree with their view that his father’s government was too friendly with the German.  In 1939, Prince Michael was given an honorary position in the Iron Guard and began advocating for Romania to break ties with both the German and Austro-Hungarian Empire. This adovocation along with vocal support from the Iron Guard lead to the Prince to gain popularity among the Romanian populace, so much so that many would prefer the young prince be the king rather than this father. This popularity also prevent Carol II from disowning him as his heir, as that move would likely cost him what little support he had. This tension between the prince and his father continue until 1942, when due to Carol II both blocking Romania from aiding the Serbs in their war against Austria-Hungary or seizing a larger part of Hungary during their intervention caused the Iron Guard to seek to replace Carol II as king. Micheal accept the Iron Guard offer to replace his father with the caveat that Carol II and his allies would be exiled rather than executed after the coup. After the successful coup and Micheal was crowned, Micheal I, found his power as King of Romania severely weakened by the new constitution. Micheal I knowing that he would not simply be able to oppose the Iron guard directly about these changes, instead began to surround himself with members of the Iron Guard who had become alienated from Codreanu’s vision due to his policies toward the monarchy and the nobility.
