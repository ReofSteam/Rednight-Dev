csa.16.t:0 "New Dawn"
csa.16.d:0 "Comrades, Representatives of the American People.\nWe have fought valiantly for nine years, weathering a brutal tragedy. This effort was possible because it was backed by dreams of tomorrow. The lights of the new decade shall greet us in a few hours, that tomorrow has finally arrived, the end of an era.\n\nYet as the dawn looms on the horizon of past twilight, I think back to 1776. Our revolutionary fathers brought upon this land a Republic, worthy of praise and predicated on the fire in men’s hearts. A longing for liberty amongst the people was harnessed to give birth to a new nation. But this Nation was imperfect. soon the coal barons, the trusts, the barbaric vampires of industry seized it to feast upon generations of toilers.\n\nIt was in that faithful year of 1941 that the American people, motivated by that very same love for the nation were aroused to its rescue. Together, they took back their Republic from a humiliation of the ages! And so it was, young men kissing their sweetheart goodbye as they gladly gave their blood to cement the republic’s wall. Their tender bodies becoming her living barricades against tyranny. Never under capitalism could such glorious deeds occur. The freedmen marched on with the most sacred of rational devotion. It was a devotion to a land they themselves were masters of, and to the machines of industry they would now captain. Against such forces, how could the slave soldiers paid by gold coin ever fare? No, they paled against the beating heart of freedom.\n\nA new year comes. The Republic that is yours asks that you remain faithful as we embark upon our grand journey. Long live the workers of America! Long Live the Socialist Republic!"
csa.16.a:0 "Thank you, Comrade Foster."

csa.91.t:0 "Protests in Chicago"
csa.91.d:0 "Another disruption has occurred in congress today. Yet again, as a controversial law was being ratified, ideological partisanship resulted in chaos. While the representatives were voting to disband and integrate the various militia units in our armed forces, a contingent of Anarchist protestors surrounded city hall. Security was overwhelmed, and although the protests were peaceful the entirety of congress found itself surrounded.\n\n Apparently, Vice President Lovestone, who happened to be within the chamber during the proceedings, placed a call to President Foster. Foster promised he would contact Speaker Flynn, head of the IWW. He was reportedly confident that those who now surrounded the building had done so without the knowledge of the union. Foster urged his colleague to be patient.\n\nHowever, while Foster attempted to reach Flynn Lovestone apparently decided to take matters into his own hands. He dialed up the Revolutionary Security Bureau, ordering them to assemble at once and use whatever means necessary to restore order.\n\nThankfully, the situation was resolved without bloodshed. Upon seeing the RSB units arrive at the building, the protests dispersed. Several warning shots were fired, spooking the rowdy bunch away from the assembly.\n\nPresident Foster has expressed outrage at the actions of Lovestone, as has speaker Flynn. When asked for a statement later in the day, Lovestone struck back. Claiming that “If the IWW cannot control its members, the guns will aim straight next time.”\n\n While his statements were inflammatory, many within both the SPA and SDP have come out in support of lovestone. In addition, several congress members have thanked him for resolving the crisis."
csa.91.a:0 "God Bless Jay Lovestone!"
csa.91.b:0 "Lovestone is a maniac!"

###Intro Tree Events ####


csa.1.t:0 "The Last President"
csa.1.d:0 "Herbert Hoover was the last charlatan president. Huey Long was the last puppet president. John Reed was the last rightful president.\n\nWilliam Foster will be the last sitting president.\n\nFoster knows this as well as the rest of the East does. His ascension was a mere formality, his election done via the rump Chicago congress in 1949. It is the original United States Constitution that gives Foster power over the “Socialist Republic of America”, so declared through a series of ad-hoc amendments grafted onto the antiquated document.\n\nDespite the limbo like state of the nation, Foster has never seen things more clearly.Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, he has judged his responsibility to be above that of the partisan struggles of the SDP and SPA. He likens his position to that of a neutral overseer. Any good overseer knows the current American status quo cannot last. A final reckoning between the forces of reform and revolution, between Marxists and Anarchists, between ruin and splendor, is fast approaching. With what little time he has left, Foster seeks to save the nation from itself.\n\nThe Refugee crisis must be dealt with before it saps the last of the nation’s greatest minds and hardest workers. The political questions must be definitively answered before they devolve into mob violence and rule of the strong. The Legacy of Foster’s old friend must be clearly spelled out.Defining who Reed was, accurate or not is vital for all future generations to come.\n\nIn American politics precedent is everything. Like George Washington did once before, Foster intends to lead the nation by example. It is a burden he is honored to carry, exempliefied by the now infamous quotation from his inagural speech."
csa.1.a:0 "We cannot build socialism between ruins and corpses."

csa.2.t:0 "A Human Drain"
csa.2.d:0 "The Midwest is a nightmare and has been so since 1947. It was in that cursed year when the infamous “Kansas Betrayal” of General Stillwell destroyed order in the region. In addition, the white forces of the west would finally unite for “Operation Takhoma”. The result of these compounding disasters is an untenable 3000 Kilometer border with the enemy. Along its great breadth are reactionary terrorists, smugglers, drug dealers, and even human traffickers. In essence, society has collapsed in the region. The combined devastation of the East and Midwest, and the comparatively unscathed nature of the West-Coast has created one of the largest refugee crises in modern history!\n\nThis is something we cannot abide. Not only are we losing crucial manpower and expertise, but our handling of the crisis is set to become an international embarrassment. Though the situation was inevitable Western propaganda has already began spewing vicious lies. They blame our socialist doctrine, rather than wartime devastation prompting the people to flee. This propaganda is so effective that even well intentioned European comrades are beginning to raise questions.\n\nThree camps have emerged in congress. The first suggests relying on a force we know is reliable; The Army. This is especially true after the self-purge of Macarthur and Stillwell’s followers. We could convene the generals and ask them to draft a border plan.\n\nThe second camp advises we establish a new border organization, perhaps as a part of our intelligence apparatus. This likely would be the most effective solution, though some in congress are wary of it.\n\nFinally, there is the third option. Some in congress believe that the crisis will naturally abate as reconstruction advances. Perhaps we are spitting in the wind by attempting to brute force the issue. Instead, we could simply focus on rebuilding the infrastructure of midwestern states to ride out the storm."
csa.2.a:0 "Convene the General Staff"
csa.2.b:0 "Form a red border patrol"
csa.2.c:0 "Focus on reconstruction. We shall endure."


csa.3.t:0 "Star Brimmed Meeting"
csa.3.d:0 "At the behest of Rowan’s impudent nod, David unfurled the map. It blanketed the table in its entirety, which was impressive for such a grand old dining room. He sauntered up first, followed by General Law. The other men caught on a moment later. In times like this, the old US army formalities were sorely missed.\n\nThe cartographer had certainly been well paid. It would be a moment before the generals comprehended the intricate puzzle before them. The shapes of Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, and Oklahoma were carpeted in a vast array of bright red stars and snaking arrows.\n\nDavid looked into Rowan’s eyes, searching for a bit of humanity. Two solid marbles returned his glance, and he knew then that the man’s heart held only dogma."
csa.3.a:0 " “Citzen-Generals, congress expects me to return with a plan” "

csa.4.t:0 "Mess Hall Bulletin"
csa.4.d:0 "Notice to all active duty personnel.\n\nThough the thugs and conspirators who would see our constitution laid low have been pushed west, the revolution remains imperiled. Already, the costal bourgeoise have begun plotting! Using their stolen wealth and untarnished industry, they prey upon the very same citizens whose homes they destroyed by initiating civil warfare.\n\nIn light of these dangerous circumstances President Foster and the Chicago Congress have authorized recruitment for a special reassignment. Please speak to your superior officer regarding service in the Great Plains reconstruction corps.\n\nToday we embark upon consolidation. Tomorrow, we embark with the rest of an unbound humanity towards a brighter future!"
csa.4.a:0 "Service guarantees significant pension increase."

csa.8.d:0 "they are elite and stuff"
csa.8.a:0 "nice"

csa.10.t:0 "Lost in thought"
csa.10.d:0 "The representatives donned their heavy jackets, eyes either red or trained on the floor. Arms were stretched towards the sky, idle whispers were spoken, and feet shambled. Each was just one trip through the biting lake Michigan air away from their bed.\n\nAt the back of the chamber sat Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, whose visage was not so sullen. She tended to weather the attrition of ceaseless debate better than the rest. It was simply a matter of experience. The border crisis was far from her first supposedly impossible task. As they filed out of the chamber she sat quietly, her old coat sprawled across the carpeted floor.\n\nIt was ignorance at best and sociopathy at worst to do nothing. Yet neither solution made any sense. Perhaps, they too were sociopathic. Could congress really ask soldiers to corral their starving countrymen? That was what they had already been doing for a decade! The agency proposal was worse. Yet another unelected and unaccountable terror in the night.\n\nAs the gears turned, she played with an earlier address. It was spoken by a quiet man, back when the sun still lingered in the sky. It was the tale of his brother, ostensibly. Yet, the city of Denver was more a character than the subject himself. Denver; a city that had seen many flags. Denver; a crater where a community once was.\n\nDenver; America’s microcosm.\n\nThe hour was soon alarmingly late. Elizabeth retrieved the coat and strolled to the chamber exit, flicking off the lights. Outside, the moon shone brightly, illuminating the way home in more ways than one."
csa.10.a:0 "Time heals all wounds, but perhaps I can lend a hand."

csa.14.t:0 "An Unpleasant Flight"
csa.14.d:0 "Foster rubbed his temples and pushed the paper aside, sick of his euglogy enduced headache. It took a moment to stumble from his seat towards the small plane refirigrator. It took another moment to find the nonexistent wine. Dissastisfied, he walked back to his seat with a harsh whiskey instead. He supposed it was a more fitting drink for an american president anyway.\n\nFoster leaned back in his chair before calling the vice president to join him from across the plane. Lovestone obliged and Foster yet again felt acutely that he did not truly know the man before him. The two had been forced together by circumstance, and still commanded seperate blocs within the SPA. It was no wonder. Yet there was no reason political enemies couldn't be at least friends, especially if they shared an office.\n\n Foster spoke "I've heard that the Russian delegation has decided to attend after all."\n\nLovestone nodded "I'm less suprised by them than I am by the IWW". His lips curled and his eyes squinted slightly. "Nothing to gain from coming, after all."\n\nFoster had his own issues with the IWW, and he knew Lovstone's views well, but Lovestone's tone still startled him. "You think so lowly of your comrades, Jay?"\n\nLovestone reached for the bottle of whiskey and poured himself a glass, talking as he did so. "I think the same of any that put childish fantasies ahead of what's best for america." he looked up at Foster before saying the next part, knowing full well it also applied to the AFL. "A party member should never have dual loyalties."\n\nFoster laughed at Lovestone's blatant insult. "Need I remind you which one of us is vice president, Jay?"
csa.14.a:0 "The Party has my back, William, not yours."

csa.15.t:0 "Revising the Speech"
csa.15.d:0 "Reed's funeral is soon, should I am going to revise the speech to change his final wishes for the sake of america, I feel bad about it."
csa.15.a:0 "time for a funeral"

csa.17.t:0 "The Funeral of Jack Reed"
csa.17.d:0 "Foster snickered as his escort arrived at Patchin Place. He stepped out of his car and stood with hands on his hips. Here was the home of Jack Reed; rightful president, savior of the masses, the “American Lenin”. It was a stubby red apartment complex, pockmarked with chipped paint from long before the civil war had started.A dinky air conditioner jutted out of a teal wall in the opposite building, which was also covered in bullet holes.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\nFoster stepped up to the hastily assembled podium at the front of the alleyway. He went for a hug, only to be offered a handshake. Louise Bryant-Reed, stubborn as ever. He grinned and whispered to her, trying to overcome the noise of all the clamoring citizens who had gathered on 8th avenue.\n\n “Jack sure knew how to pick an abode, huh?”\n\nShe smiled with the faint memory of Reed’s modest charisma. The two turned to face the crowd.\n\nFoster spoke eloquently for the first half of the eulogy. After all, this was the part that hadn’t undergone fifteen rewrites on the plane. It was about half an hour in when the page before him became full of crossed out words and hastily assembled phrases.\n\nAs the last paragraph approached, the words §B§RHis Final Wish§!§! Leaped from the page and into Foster’s throat. Foster glanced up at the sullen crowd, then deep into Louise’s eyes. They were the grieving eyes of a widow, yet they were still Louise. He felt as though she might level him depending on his next words. He was not sure he could blame her.\n\n "His final wish" Foster spoke softly "Was...""
csa.17.a:0 "To be buried amongst his comrades, forever fighting."
csa.17.b:0 "To have his ashes scattered across the land, finally at peace."

######Internal War Situation Report Events#######

csa.85.t:0 "Situation in New England"
csa.85.d:0 "New England is not Cheyenne, nor is it Bozeman. The people of the region, distant from the current frontlines of the revolution have been mostly free from strife as of late, at least as free as a place can be in present times.\n\n A string of high profile robberies have been occurring, and their targets are both puzzling and rage-inducing. Workers relief centres have been the primary recipients of these attacks, harming our most vulnerable people at a key time in reconstruction.\n\nThis would be bad enough, were it not for two additional encounters. One was between police officers and non-state forces in rural Vermont which left multiple people dead and wounded. Another was reported at Boston Harbour, where violence erupted as well.\n\n The timing of these incidents and their location is quite puzzling indeed. We must see if these events are connected in any way and track down any counter-revolutionaries or conspirators."
csa.85.a:0 "We must deal with this."

csa.87.t:0 "Situation in the Rockies"
csa.87.d:0 "Since even before the New Years peace the illegal flow of materials across the country has only ramped up in scale. Everything from black market weapons, drugs, and even human trafficking can be observed across the breadth of North America. In some places, where the long reach of Chicago or Sacramento has still not found its footing, the black market remains the only option for desperate people.\n\nRegardless of this brutal reality, however, the sooner this black market can be stamped out, the sooner our republic might recover. The new Office of the CIA in Denver has completed its maiden intelligence-gathering operations. Inside their first status report on the region was information collected from our border patrols. Over twenty illegal crossings had been attempted at various points in the week before peace went into effect. Several of the detained refugees were carrying startling cargo including heavy weaponry. Long-range observation patrols have also noted an unusual mass concentration of individuals in the lower plateau of the Rockies. Given the circumstances, we should investigate these matters at once to preserve the stability of our frontline."
csa.87.a:0 "We must deal with this."



####Internal War Operation Events####

csa.30.t:0 "An Address to the People of America" 
csa.30.d:0 "Browder wasn't nervous, but he felt like he should be, so he acted the way a nervous person might. He paced the room, drummed his fingers upon the desk and reached for his glass of water excessively. It was a maneuver, a show to underscore to his comrades in the room that he had not embarked upon his quest without consideration of alternatives. He had, of course, been nervous before,  but such doubts were long long ago smothered by reality. He knew the truth and so did foster, backlash be damned. Finally, after a few minutes of waiting it was time. They turned on the television.\n\nFoster stepped up to the podium in Denver, white hair rustling in the wind, and spoke softly “Comrades, I am here today in the  furthest reaches of our republic in the name of transparency. Transparency is perhaps the most important of virtues, a virtue that our old government lacked. If our state is to serve the people, it must be honest with them. Behind me stands the regional offices for the Central Intelligence Agency, that all too infamous organisation. The people have good reason to be wary of it, and that wariness has been made clear in the polemics  of our many great journalists and intellectuals. What I would like to respond with, however, is a quote from our now departed Comrade and the last president of the United States of America, Jack Reed, on the eve of revolution.”\n\n“The path has never been easy, and along its route lay destruction and chaos. Were it possible to construct a new society free of bloodshed, we would do so, and often we have tried. It is the task of a revolutionary to build a new society in the shadow of the old. If that new society is forced to fight for its survival then so be it. We will take to the task in earnest, always keeping in mind the humanistic ends that justify our means.”\n\nFoster finished the quote.\n\n“Comrade Reed was, as always, prophetic. We have secured for ourselves an opportunity to build this new society. It is a future without hunger, without homelessness and want. A future where the power resides in the people themselves. Yet there still remain many enemies, and indeed allies, who would destroy it. From the forests of the Rockies to the shining southern coast there are still militias that burn with hatred and terrorists who conspire vile deeds.The war is over, and we can no longer tolerate lawlessness. That is why the Central Intelligence agency must continue to exist, why it was ratified by the American Labour Congress despite reservations, and why I support it in its entirety. Rest assured that unlike the FBI or the western OSS, our organisation will be entirely beholden to…”"

### Convention Chain ###

csa.93.t:0 "Preamble"
csa.93.d:0 "On the 3rd of March 1940, the President of the United States of America, and those forces loyal to the constitution escaped a coup d’etat in the nation’s capital. These events would come to form the genesis of a decade long civil war. It was only through sacrifice that the forces of democracy would manage to survive against the onslaught. Narrowly, they would best their many tyrannical and regressive enemies.\n\nWhen it became clear that the rule of law would endure, the remaining men and women of the United States congress gathered. Deeply affected by the barbarous violence that the servants of the Bourgeoise had inflicted, and aware of centuries of ruthless exploitation, a new era was declared. The United States of America had evolved beyond its harrowing past. It was rechristened a “Socialist Republic” in consideration of newfound purpose; to provide true liberty and justice for all. The new union shall be a ...."
csa.93.a:0 "A Popular union of Democratic and Republican principles."
csa.93.b:0 "A Popular union of the American People."
csa.93.c:0 "A Popular Union, belonging to the working class of America."

csa.94.t:0 "Article Four - Commerce"
csa.94.d:0 "In Recognition of the reality that the political and economic life of a nation are inseparable, America is a nation engaged in the construction of Socialism. Commerce within the socialist republic must be conducted with this national goal in mind. To that end, commerce shall be .."
csa.94.a:0 "The exclusive domain of the National Syndicates directed by the national government."
csa.94.b:0 "Primarily conducted by the National Syndicates, with small enterprise permitted alongside."
csa.94.c:0 "The exclusive domain of the National Syndicates upon the basis of worker's self-management."

csa.106.t:0 "The Curious Sailor"
csa.106.d:0 "This morning, officers of the RSB stationed outside Independence Hall were subjected to a surprising scene. One Earnest Hemmingway, prolific journalist, comrade, and rogue adventurist. Hemmingway approached at a brisk pace with a newspaper in hand loudly demanding an audience with the convention on behalf of several obscure American journalists.\n\nWhile he was turned away like anyone else, the paper managed to make its way inside where it was read aloud. Soon, it became obvious why Hemmingway had been sent all the way to Pennsylvania.\n\nLe Marin Curieux, otherwise known as “The Curious Sailor” is a French tabloid known in Europe for vicious yellow journalism and a total lack of discretion. The paper primarily covers foreign affairs, and America, such as it is, did not disappoint. Somehow the folks in Paris have gotten ahold of intimate details regarding the convention thus far. Quotes from debates over commerce, traded insults and more are included.\n\nThankfully only a small contingent of the American populace can speak French. In addition, our gentleman’s agreement with the American press appears to be holding. While this event has caused some controversy abroad, damage has been limited by the paper’s reputation."
csa.106.a:0 "It's not what it looks like!"

csa.107.t:0 "The Brewing Catastrophe"
csa.107.d:0 "Disaster! Sympathetic comrades within the editorial staff of “The Masses” have tipped us off regarding a great drama brewing within American journalism. Within the rapidly regrowing sector of American news, papers have been competing at breakneck pace for control of a vast readership. Once, it was held   by now defunct papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Times. \n\nThough the press pledged to honor our gentleman’s agreement, the information present upon the pages of the latest “The Curious Sailor” is apparently too lucrative to turn down. Details of our convention are a huge story, considering much of the public is unaware that a convention is even taking place. Eager to spin a tale for an English-speaking audience, journalists across the nation are quietly requesting meetings with the team behind the original article.\n\nWere details of the convention to leak prematurely there would be an upheaval, regardless of political tendency! Militiamen, strikers, and protestors would undoubtedly be mobilized. As a result, the convention could be influenced or even undone by public pressure and thuggery.\n\nThe delegates have been called to an emergency session, to be held tomorrow morning. There is still a short window of time before the news breaks."
csa.107.a:0 "Assemble the convention!"

csa.95.t:0 "Convention Motion- Press Slience"
csa.95.d:0 "The convention is engaged in a furious but short debate regarding the brewing press crisis. Our gentleman’s agreement failed to account for foreign journalists, and as a result, someone in the convention began acting as an anonymous source for French papers. We are unable to correct this oversight. However, we can still mitigate the damage.\n\nMany SDP delegates in Independence Hall are urging we file a motion to quietly deport all foreign journalists immediately. This would easily stop the story in its tracks, saving the convention and protecting the integrity of the constitution.\n\nTo the SPA delegates, the benefits of such an action are far outweighed by the consequences. Not only would such a move irreparably harm relations with Europe, but it might be an even larger story in of itself. Instead, they advocate that we remind the domestic press of our Gentleman’s agreement and forcefully dissolve any paper that refuses to abide by it.\n\nFinally, the Independent IWW delegates have rejected both options. Typical to their character, they refuse to launch an “assault on  free speech”, claiming that  censorship would set a dangerous precedent. Of course, with a support base amongst unionized workers and Militiamen, they stand to lose the least should the story come out."
csa.95.a:0 "Motion Carried- Deport the muckrakers."
csa.95.b:0 "Motion Carried- Renew the Gentlemans Agreement."
csa.95.c:0 "Motion Repealed- Uphold Freedom of the Press, regardless of the consequences."

csa.96.t:0 "Article Five - Legislature"
csa.96.d:0 "Legislative power in America shall derive primarily from the supreme legislative body. Beyond extralegal duties, the executive shall be subservient to this body and carry out its will.\n\nThe supreme executive body shall be…"

csa.102.t:0 "The Final Day of the Convention"
csa.102.d:0 "It's over.\n\nFor better or worse, the path laid down nearly a century ago has reached it's end. All that remains are a few trivial articles. No matter what form it takes, the only question facing the delegation now is whether a constitution shall pass.\n\nIn every seat of Independence Hall fists tighten and eyelids narrow. Every shouting match, every political crisis, every bullet fired and slogan chanted has led to this; a final vote. Can the convention overcome partisanship, or will it sink any chance at a new document?" 
csa.102.a:0 "We did our best..."

csa.103.t:0 "Yay or Nay?"
csa.103.d:0 "The independent delegate rose slowly, her shaky knees refusing to match her genuine smile. A cough erupted from the man behind involuntarily, echoing against the chamber’s old oak ceiling. She surveyed the giants around her; names like Flynn, Tresca, and Rowan. Each returned a nerve-racking stare. She was a piece of meat, thrust into the lion’s den.\n\nThe words croaked into her own cough, induced by the man behind. Comrade Tresca stuck his head between his knees, sure of the result like the rest of them, but straining to remain quiet any longer.\n\n"I Vote"\n\n"Ahem"\n\n"I Vote yay"\n\nThe blast of voices threw her from her feet, backwards into the chair. Her smile developed into a grin as the chorus drowned any pretense. A new nation, once and for all!\n\nAcross the chamber, the tears flowed freely. A few angry, a few sad.\n\nMost were happy."
csa.103.a:0 "Bust out the champagne!"

csa.104.t:0 "1947 Constitution Defended"
csa.104.d:0 "Flynn looked up, instinctively searching for the sky. They were soulmates; a sky that ached to be seen and a dizzy mind that longed for escape. Instead, she found only a cross-beam and a badly mounted lightbulb.\n\nIt truly was an eldritch nightmare. Four rotten old oak walls pressing inwards, the room spinning as if it were a ship at sea, the bulb burning a hole in her skull.\n\nShe knew the constitution had failed minutes ago, simply by the number of “nay’s” that had echoed across the chamber. They all did. A woman of action, Flynn should have been planning next steps.\n\nInstead, she felt all the years catch up to her.  A deep depression set in in that moment, from which she would never truly recover.\n\nWhat was it all for?"
csa.104.a:0 "The Status quo, forever."


csa.105.t:0 "Extreme Political Deadlock"
csa.105.d:0 "The Independent delegate rose slowly, her shaky knees betraying the masked terror of her visage. In this great big chamber, enclosed by massive oak and filled with uncomfortable chairs, she was truly alone.\n\nThe man behind her coughed loud enough to startle her, breaking the tension of their stares.\n\n“I vote yay”\n\nShe breathed a sigh of relief, and yet no great jubilation began. Nor did a great sadness. Comrade Tresca’s head rose from between his legs. She followed his gaze to the front of the chamber, where the vote had been tallied.\n\nSuddenly, Tresca was seized by a boisterous laughter."
csa.105.a:0 "A perfect tie, how is such an absurdity possible!?!"

csa.108.t:0 "The Cat's Outta the Bag"

The nightmare had finally ended, and amongst the blackened skyscrapers and burning fields the people quietly celebrate.\n\nNow we sit in brief reprise, gathering strength for the pale horse's return. There are few people across the Earth's surface that have experienced what the American people have."
CSA_ruins:0 "America in Ruins"
CSA_ruins_desc: "A decade of carnage that saw multiple pretender goverments and razed cities has destroyed the east. Nearly every major landmark has endured some kind of damage. In the cities, still-inhabited apartment complexes stand next to blackened towers and mazes of steel rebar. In the countryside, dead cattle lay beside collapsed barns, their blood splayed on what few crops remain. America is beautiful no more."

However, by 1947 that alliance had nearly collapsed. It is not only loyalty to the SDP or SPA that is today disputed. Questions of union vs party, reform vs revolution, and pragmatism vs ideology are tearing our republic apart. One way or another the deadlock will be solved."

It will require a serious undertaking to reassure our people and prevent the west from taking advantage of these rebels.\n\n§RFailure to combat enemies of the state will have dire consequences§!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_WILLIAM_Z_FOSTER_DESC: "Jack Reed led the American left through sheer force of personality. Without the infectious zeal and near inexhaustible charisma of that bohemian reporter, the constitutionalist army surely would have perished in 1941. On the surface William Z Foster is incomparable. His demeanor is steady, boring even. His over-riding trait seems to be pragmatism. He is known for his simple desire to organize workers. He infamously opted to bore within the AFL, rather than deal directly with the SPA or IWW. A decision that ultimately proved vital to success and made him a pillar of American syndicalism.\n\nLike an iceberg, Foster’s surface is deceiving. He is not a Machiavellian who holds no beliefs of his own. Though he may coincidentally appeal to different tendencies at different times, he is always chasing a north star. An Industrial state and workers self-management, as he witnessed in France, above all else.\n\nThose who truly know Foster hold no doubt. The man is a force of his own. He is willing to take many paths towards his goal, be they Marxist or Anarchist. Yet, the goal shall never waver."
POLITICS_JOHN_BIRCH_DESC: "John Birch was once a zealot, a vicious young man with a great stirring in his breast. The lord was his compass, and it was with divine endowment that John would guide his countrymen to the kingdom of heaven. When the devil began to whisper in some American ears, they too became zealouts. Soon the perfidious cries of socialism, and the egomaniacal machinations of Longism echoed across the land. Their voices drowned John’s out. After joining the army and rising to the rank of an officer, he watched with horror as the red tide drowned America in blood.\n\nThe new and sobering reality humbled John. Slowly, he found the wisdom of speaking softly. In secret, Officer Birch became a key OSS asset in the great plains.\n\nNow, as the fools who led America astray bicker amongst themselves, Birch has taken the opportunity. John has matured with age, but his willingness to die for Christian civilization continues to simmer under the surface. With God on his side he will help Sacramento push the traitors to the sea!"
