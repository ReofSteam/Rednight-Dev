csa.16.t:0 "New Dawn"
csa.16.d:0 "Comrades, Representatives of the American People.\nWe have fought valiantly for nine years, weathering a brutal tragedy. This effort was possible because it was backed by dreams of tomorrow. The lights of the new decade shall greet us in a few hours, that tomorrow has finally arrived, the end of an era.\n\nYet as the dawn looms on the horizon of past twilight, I think back to 1776. Our revolutionary fathers brought upon this land a Republic, worthy of praise and predicated on the fire in men’s hearts. A longing for liberty amongst the people was harnessed to give birth to a new nation. But this Nation was imperfect. soon the coal barons, the trusts, the barbaric vampires of industry seized it to feast upon generations of toilers.\n\nIt was in that faithful year of 1941 that the American people, motivated by that very same love for the nation were aroused to its rescue. Together, they took back their Republic from a humiliation of the ages! And so it was, young men kissing their sweetheart goodbye as they gladly gave their blood to cement the republic’s wall. Their tender bodies becoming her living barricades against tyranny. Never under capitalism could such glorious deeds occur. The freedmen marched on with the most sacred of rational devotion. It was a devotion to a land they themselves were masters of, and to the machines of industry they would now captain. Against such forces, how could the slave soldiers paid by gold coin ever fare? No, they paled against the beating heart of freedom.\n\nA new year comes. The Republic that is yours asks that you remain faithful as we embark upon our grand journey. Long live the workers of America! Long Live the Socialist Republic!"
csa.16.a:0 "Thank you, Comrade Foster."

csa.91.t:0 "Protests in Chicago"
csa.91.d:0 "Another disruption has occurred in congress today. Yet again, as a controversial law was being ratified, ideological partisanship resulted in chaos. While the representatives were voting to disband and integrate the various militia units in our armed forces, a contingent of Anarchist protestors surrounded city hall. Security was overwhelmed, and although the protests were peaceful the entirety of congress found itself surrounded.\n\n Apparently, Vice President Lovestone, who happened to be within the chamber during the proceedings, placed a call to President Foster. Foster promised he would contact Speaker Flynn, head of the IWW. He was reportedly confident that those who now surrounded the building had done so without the knowledge of the union. Foster urged his colleague to be patient.\n\nHowever, while Foster attempted to reach Flynn Lovestone apparently decided to take matters into his own hands. He dialed up the Revolutionary Security Bureau, ordering them to assemble at once and use whatever means necessary to restore order.\n\nThankfully, the situation was resolved without bloodshed. Upon seeing the RSB units arrive at the building, the protests dispersed. Several warning shots were fired, spooking the rowdy bunch away from the assembly.\n\nPresident Foster has expressed outrage at the actions of Lovestone, as has speaker Flynn. When asked for a statement later in the day, Lovestone struck back. Claiming that “If the IWW cannot control its members, the guns will aim straight next time.”\n\n While his statements were inflammatory, many within both the SPA and SDP have come out in support of lovestone. In addition, several congress members have thanked him for resolving the crisis."
csa.91.a:0 "God Bless Jay Lovestone!"
csa.91.b:0 "Lovestone is a maniac!"

###Intro Tree Events ####


csa.1.t:0 "The Last President"
csa.1.d:0 "Herbert Hoover was the last charlatan president. Huey Long was the last puppet president. John Reed was the last rightful president.\n\nWilliam Foster will be the last sitting president.\n\nFoster knows this as well as the rest of the East does. His ascension was a mere formality, his election done via the rump Chicago congress in 1949. It is the original United States Constitution that gives Foster power over the “Socialist Republic of America”, so declared through a series of ad-hoc amendments grafted onto the antiquated document.\n\nDespite the limbo like state of the nation, Foster has never seen things more clearly.Following in the footsteps of his predecessor, he has judged his responsibility to be above that of the partisan struggles of the SDP and SPA. He likens his position to that of a neutral overseer. Any good overseer knows the current American status quo cannot last. A final reckoning between the forces of reform and revolution, between Marxists and Anarchists, between ruin and splendor, is fast approaching. With what little time he has left, Foster seeks to save the nation from itself.\n\nThe Refugee crisis must be dealt with before it saps the last of the nation’s greatest minds and hardest workers. The political questions must be definitively answered before they devolve into mob violence and rule of the strong. The Legacy of Foster’s old friend must be clearly spelled out.Defining who Reed was, accurate or not is vital for all future generations to come.\n\nIn American politics precedent is everything. Like George Washington did once before, Foster intends to lead the nation by example. It is a burden he is honored to carry, exempliefied by the now infamous quotation from his inagural speech."
csa.1.a:0 "We cannot build socialism between ruins and corpses."

csa.2.t:0 "A Human Drain"
csa.2.d:0 "The Midwest is a nightmare and has been so since 1947. It was in that cursed year when the infamous “Kansas Betrayal” of General Stillwell destroyed order in the region. In addition, the white forces of the west would finally unite for “Operation Takhoma”. The result of these compounding disasters is an untenable 3000 Kilometer border with the enemy. Along its great breadth are reactionary terrorists, smugglers, drug dealers, and even human traffickers. In essence, society has collapsed in the region. The combined devastation of the East and Midwest, and the comparatively unscathed nature of the West-Coast has created one of the largest refugee crises in modern history!\n\nThis is something we cannot abide. Not only are we losing crucial manpower and expertise, but our handling of the crisis is set to become an international embarrassment. Though the situation was inevitable Western propaganda has already began spewing vicious lies. They blame our socialist doctrine, rather than wartime devastation prompting the people to flee. This propaganda is so effective that even well intentioned European comrades are beginning to raise questions.\n\nThree camps have emerged in congress. The first suggests relying on a force we know is reliable; The Army. This is especially true after the self-purge of Macarthur and Stillwell’s followers. We could convene the generals and ask them to draft a border plan.\n\nThe second camp advises we establish a new border organization, perhaps as a part of our intelligence apparatus. This likely would be the most effective solution, though some in congress are wary of it.\n\nFinally, there is the third option. Some in congress believe that the crisis will naturally abate as reconstruction advances. Perhaps we are spitting in the wind by attempting to brute force the issue. Instead, we could simply focus on rebuilding the infrastructure of midwestern states to ride out the storm."
csa.2.a:0 "Convene the General Staff"
csa.2.b:0 "Form a red border patrol"

csa.10.t:0 "Lost in thought"
csa.10.d:0 "The representatives donned their heavy jackets, eyes either red or trained on the floor. Arms were stretched towards the sky, idle whispers were spoken, and feet shambled. Each was just one trip through the biting lake Michigan air away from their bed.\n\nAt the back of the chamber sat Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, whose visage was not so sullen. She tended to weather the attrition of ceaseless debate better than the rest. It was simply a matter of experience. The border crisis was far from her first supposedly impossible task. As they filed out of the chamber she sat quietly, her old coat sprawled across the carpeted floor.\n\nIt was ignorance at best and sociopathy at worst to do nothing. Yet neither solution made any sense. Perhaps, they too were sociopathic. Could congress really ask soldiers to corral their starving countrymen? That was what they had already been doing for a decade! The agency proposal was worse. Yet another unelected and unaccountable terror in the night.\n\nAs the gears turned, she played with an earlier address. It was spoken by a quiet man, back when the sun still lingered in the sky. It was the tale of his brother, ostensibly. Yet, the city of Denver was more a character than the subject himself. Denver; a city that had seen many flags. Denver; a crater where a community once was.\n\nDenver; America’s microcosm.\n\nThe hour was soon alarmingly late. Elizabeth retrieved the coat and strolled to the chamber exit, flicking off the lights. Outside, the moon shone brightly, illuminating the way home in more ways than one."
csa.10.a:0 "Time heals all wounds, but perhaps I can lend a hand."

csa.14.t:0 "An Unpleasant Flight"
csa.14.d:0 "Foster rubbed his temples and pushed the paper aside, sick of his euglogy enduced headache. It took a moment to stumble from his seat towards the small plane refirigrator. It took another moment to find the nonexistent wine. Dissastisfied, he walked back to his seat with a harsh whiskey instead. He supposed it was a more fitting drink for an american president anyway.\n\nFoster leaned back in his chair before calling the vice president to join him from across the plane. Lovestone obliged and Foster yet again felt acutely that he did not truly know the man before him. The two had been forced together by circumstance, and still commanded seperate blocs within the SPA. It was no wonder. Yet there was no reason political enemies couldn't be at least friends, especially if they shared an office.\n\n Foster spoke "I've heard that the Russian delegation has decided to attend after all."\n\nLovestone nodded "I'm less suprised by them than I am by the IWW". His lips curled and his eyes squinted slightly. "Nothing to gain from coming, after all."\n\nFoster had his own issues with the IWW, and he knew Lovstone's views well, but Lovestone's tone still startled him. "You think so lowly of your comrades, Jay?"\n\nLovestone reached for the bottle of whiskey and poured himself a glass, talking as he did so. "I think the same of any that put childish fantasies ahead of what's best for america." he looked up at Foster before saying the next part, knowing full well it also applied to the AFL. "A party member should never have dual loyalties."\n\nFoster laughed at Lovestone's blatant insult. "Need I remind you which one of us is vice president, Jay?"
csa.14.a:0 "The Party has my back, William, not yours."

csa.15.t:0 "Revising the Speech"
csa.15.d:0 "Reed's funeral is soon, should I am going to revise the speech to change his final wishes for the sake of america, I feel bad about it."
csa.15.a:0 "time for a funeral"

csa.17.t:0 "The Funeral of Jack Reed"
csa.17.d:0 "Foster snickered as his escort arrived at Patchin Place. He stepped out of his car and stood with hands on his hips. Here was the home of Jack Reed; rightful president, savior of the masses, the “American Lenin”. It was a stubby red apartment complex, pockmarked with chipped paint from long before the civil war had started.A dinky air conditioner jutted out of a teal wall in the opposite building, which was also covered in bullet holes.\n\nIt was perfect.\n\nFoster stepped up to the hastily assembled podium at the front of the alleyway. He went for a hug, only to be offered a handshake. Louise Bryant-Reed, stubborn as ever. He grinned and whispered to her, trying to overcome the noise of all the clamoring citizens who had gathered on 8th avenue.\n\n “Jack sure knew how to pick an abode, huh?”\n\nShe smiled with the faint memory of Reed’s modest charisma. The two turned to face the crowd.\n\nFoster spoke eloquently for the first half of the eulogy. After all, this was the part that hadn’t undergone fifteen rewrites on the plane. It was about half an hour in when the page before him became full of crossed out words and hastily assembled phrases.\n\nAs the last paragraph approached, the words §B§RHis Final Wish§!§! Leaped from the page and into Foster’s throat. Foster glanced up at the sullen crowd, then deep into Louise’s eyes. They were the grieving eyes of a widow, yet they were still Louise. He felt as though she might level him depending on his next words. He was not sure he could blame her.\n\n "His final wish" Foster spoke softly "Was...""
csa.17.a:0 "To be buried amongst his comrades, forever fighting."
csa.17.b:0 "To have his ashes scattered across the land, finally at peace."

######Internal War Situation Report Events#######

csa.85.t:0 "Situation in New England"
csa.85.d:0 "New England is not Cheyenne, nor is it Bozeman. The people of the region, distant from the current frontlines of the revolution have been mostly free from strife as of late, at least as free as a place can be in present times.\n\n A string of high profile robberies have been occurring, and their targets are both puzzling and rage-inducing. Workers relief centres have been the primary recipients of these attacks, harming our most vulnerable people at a key time in reconstruction.\n\nThis would be bad enough, were it not for two additional encounters. One was between police officers and non-state forces in rural Vermont which left multiple people dead and wounded. Another was reported at Boston Harbour, where violence erupted as well.\n\n The timing of these incidents and their location is quite puzzling indeed. We must see if these events are connected in any way and track down any counter-revolutionaries or conspirators."
csa.85.a:0 "We must deal with this."

csa.87.t:0 "Situation in the Rockies"
csa.87.d:0 "Since even before the New Years peace the illegal flow of materials across the country has only ramped up in scale. Everything from black market weapons, drugs, and even human trafficking can be observed across the breadth of North America. In some places, where the long reach of Chicago or Sacramento has still not found its footing, the black market remains the only option for desperate people.\n\nRegardless of this brutal reality, however, the sooner this black market can be stamped out, the sooner our republic might recover. The new Office of the CIA in Denver has completed its maiden intelligence-gathering operations. Inside their first status report on the region was information collected from our border patrols. Over twenty illegal crossings had been attempted at various points in the week before peace went into effect. Several of the detained refugees were carrying startling cargo including heavy weaponry. Long-range observation patrols have also noted an unusual mass concentration of individuals in the lower plateau of the Rockies. Given the circumstances, we should investigate these matters at once to preserve the stability of our frontline."
csa.87.a:0 "We must deal with this."

csa.30.t:0 "An Address to the People of America" 
csa.30.d:0 "Browder wasn't nervous, but he felt like he should be, so he acted the way a nervous person might. He paced the room, drummed his fingers upon the desk and reached for his glass of water excessively. It was a maneuver, a show to underscore to his comrades in the room that he had not embarked upon his quest without consideration of alternatives. He had, of course, been nervous before,  but such doubts were long long ago smothered by reality. He knew the truth and so did foster, backlash be damned. Finally, after a few minutes of waiting it was time. They turned on the television.\n\nFoster stepped up to the podium in Denver, white hair rustling in the wind, and spoke softly “Comrades, I am here today in the  furthest reaches of our republic in the name of transparency. Transparency is perhaps the most important of virtues, a virtue that our old government lacked. If our state is to serve the people, it must be honest with them. Behind me stands the regional offices for the Central Intelligence Agency, that all too infamous organisation. The people have good reason to be wary of it, and that wariness has been made clear in the polemics  of our many great journalists and intellectuals. What I would like to respond with, however, is a quote from our now departed Comrade and the last president of the United States of America, Jack Reed, on the eve of revolution.”\n\n“The path has never been easy, and along its route lay destruction and chaos. Were it possible to construct a new society free of bloodshed, we would do so, and often we have tried. It is the task of a revolutionary to build a new society in the shadow of the old. If that new society is forced to fight for its survival then so be it. We will take to the task in earnest, always keeping in mind the humanistic ends that justify our means.”\n\nFoster finished the quote.\n\n“Comrade Reed was, as always, prophetic. We have secured for ourselves an opportunity to build this new society. It is a future without hunger, without homelessness and want. A future where the power resides in the people themselves. Yet there still remain many enemies, and indeed allies, who would destroy it. From the forests of the Rockies to the shining southern coast there are still militias that burn with hatred and terrorists who conspire vile deeds.The war is over, and we can no longer tolerate lawlessness. That is why the Central Intelligence agency must continue to exist, why it was ratified by the American Labour Congress despite reservations, and why I support it in its entirety. Rest assured that unlike the FBI or the western OSS, our organisation will be entirely beholden to…”"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_WILLIAM_Z_FOSTER_DESC: "Jack Reed led the American left through sheer force of personality. Without the infectious zeal and near inexhaustible charisma of that bohemian reporter, the constitutionalist army surely would have perished in 1941. On the surface William Z Foster is incomparable. His demeanor is steady, boring even. His over-riding trait seems to be pragmatism. He is known for his simple desire to organize workers. He infamously opted to bore within the AFL, rather than deal directly with the SPA or IWW. A decision that ultimately proved vital to success and made him a pillar of American syndicalism.\n\nLike an iceberg, Foster’s surface is deceiving. He is not a Machiavellian who holds no beliefs of his own. Though he may coincidentally appeal to different tendencies at different times, he is always chasing a north star. An Industrial state and workers self-management, as he witnessed in France, above all else.\n\nThose who truly know Foster hold no doubt. The man is a force of his own. He is willing to take many paths towards his goal, be they Marxist or Anarchist. Yet, the goal shall never waver."
