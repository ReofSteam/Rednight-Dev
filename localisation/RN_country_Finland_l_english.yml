fin.2.t:0 "Liberation of Helsinki"
fin.2.d:0 "He shifted feverishly, unable to find comfort behind his sand-bag perch. Each breath into the frigid midnight air was unbelievably heavy, riddled with genuine terror. Across his head sat a bloody gash, the cherry on top of a whiplashed and weary conscript, sent to defend Helsinki with no warning, boots untied./n/n"Fuck!" A voice rang out into the night, some asshole from farther down the line, tanking the already shattered morale that their Commissar had been working to rebuild since the surprise attack this morning.The distant shots had become deafening, and within minutes, the rebels were upon them./n/n"Please, please Please" Adrik muttered to himself, still in disbelief. Just days ago he had been laughing with his comrades, the care free tyrants of the Helsinki garrison. Together they had ruled the city, dispensing their own justice wherever they went, drinking the local liquor and "Joking" with the local rabble. Now, with only a day's warning, he found himself fighting for dear life. He regretted it all, and more than anything, he just wanted to find his way home to Irkutsk. If an opportunity arose, he thought he might end up scrambling away in the chaos and dark./n/nAcross the City, another soul wandered. Though his boots too were untied, his breath held nothing but Joy. Long had he languished in the forest, haunted by the impossibility of his task, yet trapped in it by the memories of those he had lost. Today, for the first time in a long time. He had stood up. WIth the moonlight on his face, he advanced steadily inwards. The future finally seemed possible. As he converged on the city center with his comrades, he spotted a heading peeking out from the sandbags atop a hill. Slowly, his weapon turned to meet the sight, and gunfire erupted from both directions."
fin.2.a:0 "Long live our homeland!"
fin.4.t:0 "Charting a Course"
fin.4.d:0 "In the Streets of a newly liberated Helsinki, lurking within the depths of the halls of power was a roomful of Generals. Taking turns to speak, each man was more fervent than the last. It was a room full of teapots, shrieking with pressure and nearing their time to explode.\n\nSome advocated unity above all else. Brotherhood between socialist and nationalist alike. A separation, the argued, was not only reprehensible, it was suicidal! To face down the Russian monster that encroached upon their revolutionary dream, they could have no petty squabbles amongst themselves. In addition, practical realities necessitated cooperation, when one considered the vast amounts of aid being shipped in by the French. Besides, what mattered most was that Finland was independent, and issues of economics could be settled amicably later.\n\nHowever, a much more common voice came to rise to the top of the chorus. While it was true that much aid had come from France, and that a national unity government would prevent alienating their main Arms supplier, such a government would be gravely dangerous. Tolerating left wing partisans in the struggle would only embolden them to take future actions. The Secret army fought for a free and Independent Finland, not a chaotic French puppet. Leftists have historically proven unwilling to work with those they considered reactionary. If the Generals were not careful, soon all the right wing politicians and old political figures from the Kingdom would find themselves sent before "People's Tribunals"\n\nUltimately, silence finally settled after an hours long debate. With it came scribbles upon paper, and a tally of votes."
fin.4.a:0 "The Secret Army fights for Finland. Leftist traitors be damned!"
fin.4.b:0 "We must stand united in the face of the enemy. National Unity above all else!"
