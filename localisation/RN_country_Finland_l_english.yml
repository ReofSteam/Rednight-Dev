fin.2.t:0 "Liberation of Helsinki"
fin.2.d:0 "He shifted feverishly, unable to find comfort behind his sand-bag perch. Each breath into the frigid midnight air was unbelievably heavy, riddled with genuine terror. Across his head sat a bloody gash, the cherry on top of a whiplashed and weary conscript, sent to defend Helsinki with no warning, boots untied./n/n"Fuck!" A voice rang out into the night, some asshole from farther down the line, tanking the already shattered morale that their Commissar had been working to rebuild since the surprise attack this morning.The distant shots had become deafening, and within minutes, the rebels were upon them./n/n"Please, please Please" Adrik muttered to himself, still in disbelief. Just days ago he had been laughing with his comrades, the care free tyrants of the Helsinki garrison. Together they had ruled the city, dispensing their own justice wherever they went, drinking the local liquor and "Joking" with the local rabble. Now, with only a day's warning, he found himself fighting for dear life. He regretted it all, and more than anything, he just wanted to find his way home to Irkutsk. If an opportunity arose, he thought he might end up scrambling away in the chaos and dark./n/nAcross the City, another soul wandered. Though his boots too were untied, his breath held nothing but Joy. Long had he languished in the forest, haunted by the impossibility of his task, yet trapped in it by the memories of those he had lost. Today, for the first time in a long time. He had stood up. WIth the moonlight on his face, he advanced steadily inwards. The future finally seemed possible. As he converged on the city center with his comrades, he spotted a heading peeking out from the sandbags atop a hill. Slowly, his weapon turned to meet the sight, and gunfire erupted from both directions."
fin.2.a:0 "Long live our homeland!"
fin.4.t:0 "Charting a Course"
fin.4.d:0 "In the Streets of a newly liberated Helsinki, lurking within the depths of the halls of power was a roomful of Generals. Taking turns to speak, each man was more fervent than the last. It was a room full of teapots, shrieking with pressure and nearing their time to explode.\n\nSome advocated unity above all else. Brotherhood between socialist and nationalist alike. A separation, the argued, was not only reprehensible, it was suicidal! To face down the Russian monster that encroached upon their revolutionary dream, they could have no petty squabbles amongst themselves. In addition, practical realities necessitated cooperation, when one considered the vast amounts of aid being shipped in by the French. Besides, what mattered most was that Finland was independent, and issues of economics could be settled amicably later.\n\nHowever, a much more common voice came to rise to the top of the chorus. While it was true that much aid had come from France, and that a national unity government would prevent alienating their main Arms supplier, such a government would be gravely dangerous. Tolerating left wing partisans in the struggle would only embolden them to take future actions. The Secret army fought for a free and Independent Finland, not a chaotic French puppet. Leftists have historically proven unwilling to work with those they considered reactionary. If the Generals were not careful, soon all the right wing politicians and old political figures from the Kingdom would find themselves sent before "People's Tribunals"\n\nUltimately, silence finally settled after an hours long debate. With it came scribbles upon paper, and a tally of votes."
fin.4.a:0 "The Secret Army fights for Finland. Leftist traitors be damned!"
fin.4.b:0 "We must stand united in the face of the enemy. National Unity above all else!"
fin.6.t:0 "Warsaw Peace Conference"
fin.6.d:0 "When we emerged from exile no amount of strategy could lessen the daunting nature of our task. Fear was to be found in as great a quantity, if not greater than hope..\n\nHowever, the secret army has held out far longer than was expected. Our gallant soldiers have proven the martial courage of our race.\n\n Despite these victories, the clock is softly ticking. The Russians do not know it, but our supplies have begun to run dry alongside the morale of our soldiers. What was once a rapid dash towards liberation is slowly becoming a defensive slog.\n\n The fruits of past victory have not yet withered, and our current position of strength now lends an opportunity. Moscow has proposed we send a delegation to neutral Poland. They have guaranteed the safety of this delegation, and are claiming the time has come for us to discuss terms. This means laying down arms, and potentially a compromise instead of full independence.\nn\Our foremost duty is to the people. If we fight on, the casualties could be dire. The flame of Finnish independence must not die in an unknown grave in Lapland!\n\n Should we negotiate while we can?"
fin.6.a:0 "We must know our limits"
fin.6.b:0 "It's liberty, independence or death!"
fin.7.t:0 "The Finnish Rebellion"
fin.7.d:0 "The situation in the North is dire! Though they were swiftly cut off, our patrols in Lapland reported unusual military formations all across the region. In conjunction with this news was stories of armed bands across the entire Finland administration. Apparently, these militants have been hanging up posters and attacking uniformed personnel. Their brutality was especially pronounced in the capital, where the defenders of Viapori Fortress struggled against outright siege! Such an operation was likely an attempt to rescue officers of the old Finnish army who have been detained there since the occupation began, as well as to access the large armoury.\n\nThe situation is dire, yet not all is lost. The NVS 2nd Petrogard Brigade claims to have repelled the main assault on the Helsinki city centre. They have begun to survey the situation east of them and confirmed to Moscow that contact with towns in that direction is lost. With the sheer scale of the insurgency, it is assured that the Gendarmerie are complicit in the attack across the nation, not just in the assault on Viapori. This means that we must treat all local forces as unreliable.\n\nThis is no riot. A major rebellion is underway in what was thought to be the most stable of reconquered territories. We cannot tolerate humiliation by criminals and marauders. Governor-General Sergey Taboritsky has been reminded that his personal honour is now at stake, and the incident in the Steppes four years ago shall be re-evaluated.\n\nFor now, we have granted Taboritsky access to all uniformed forces in Finland. In the face of an extraordinary crisis, we shall not falter!"
fin.7.a:0 "Damned traitors!"
fin.8.t:0 "Appeal of National Liberation"
fin.8.d:0 "Soldiers, Citizens of the fatherland!\n\nAt 3 AM, early today, your Armed Forces, who have never surrendered and have never broken our oath to the poor homeland, broke the Russian border guards and marched to the front to face the traitors and the foreigners. \nThe Hour of Insurrection has come!\nThis is call to arms for our people to seize back the independence of our homeland!\nThe Secret Army, long cherishing the flame of resistance in their tortured chest, have risen up from the shadow of the oppressor once again in the tradition of our brave forefathers, like Taneli Luukkoinen and Jaakko Ilkka before us as the National Liberation Army of Finland in the bright daylight before the Lord.\nOfficers and soldiers of the National Liberation Army of Finland!\nUnder the orders of the Free Finland Committee; henceforth, the Provisional Government of Finland, you must concentrate your forces and attack the cities and strongholds of the enemy, block their paths of retreat and disarm them. Against all odds, you must triumph! For our sake, Finnish warriors!\nPatriots of Finland!\nOur homeland is dying, but you are still soundly asleep in your dreams of sorrow. No, my compatriots, our fate must not be so cruel. Will the Finnish nation, the Finnish people face our destiny of extinction with eyes wide open and unbearable humiliation? No, citizens, prosecutions will not be the norm of today; and if destiny challenges us, we must take back our fate with our own strong hands. Let us go to our grave as free men as our fame echoes throughout eternity.\n\nWith an undaunted spirit and extreme caution, we have returned to call you to arms once more. The Fatherland is demanding greater expectations and sacrifices from you!"
fin.8.a:0 "Long live our homeland!"
rus.13.t:0 "Victory!"
rus.13.d:0 "Like a snowball on a hill the revolution has rapidly grown! The gallant children of Finland have not forgotten their fatherland, and when the time came they joined with the exiles to expel the bastards. 1917 was reborn in 1950!\n\nThe Bells of Helsinki cry out in joy. The Russians have no choice but to recognize our independence. While the direction of the new state may be fiercely debated in the days to come, for now we must all celebrate.\n\nThe people of Finland have humbled a superpower. The world is watching for our next move. The struggle is fulfilled."
rus.13.a:0 "We stand tall!"
#########Tabby is dead, you are not human!
rustabby.1.t:0 "An Ambush"
rustabby.1.d:0 "Taboritsky sat back in his car as he would be driven home from his personal estate on the lovely Baltic Sea coast, looking southwards towards Petrograd across the sea. Taboritsky smiled and raised up a bit.\n\n“Driver, slow down a bit, I’d like to enjoy the countryside.”\n\n“But sir, what about the rebels?”\n\n“We shall be fine, the Ministry is overtly cautious as usual.”\n\nThe driver simply smiled and complied, the car slowing down as they passed through the finnish countryside. They would begin to turn a curb on a winding road when a finnish man pulled an MP-40 from his Jacket and attempted to fire, but it had jammed. As the partisan began to unjam his gun. Taboritsky shouted at his driver, while pulling out his pistol.\n\n“SLOW DOWN!”\n\nTaboritsky pulled out a pistol and began to fire at the rebel, with the rebel taking cover behind a log to unjam his weapon. Unknown to them, another rebel lurked from behind the car, quicking throwing an Anti-Tank Grenade under the car and then bursting towards cover across the road. Taboritsky saw him run and turned to shoot him, he was suddenly thrown out of the car back a few yards as it bursted into a fiery wreckage on the dirt road. Before he could even react, the rebel approached him, filling him with lead from his MP-40.\n\nAlone on the road, Taboritsky’s corpse was doused in gasoline and thrown onto the burning wreckage of the car. \nMany hours later, a Russian patrol would finally found the ambush site, being sent out to escort the Governor back to Helsinki. They found what's left of the currently former Governor-General of Finland lying beside his car, as the Finnish snow, or perhaps it was Finlandia herself, began to bury him"
