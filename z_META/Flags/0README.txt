Flags should be stored in the following fashion:
	1)	The filename must be of the format <country_name>_<ideology>.<filetype>
			If the country has a generic or otherwise uncertain ideology, try to put some other distinctifier
	2)	They should preffereably be stored as .svg s, as .svg is a vector format it is both smaller and easier to alter than raster gfx (ex: .png, .jpg).
	3)	 They should be of the following ratio: 41:26, preferrably at least 820x520 (if they are not a .svg)

HOI4 Flag Format:
.tga or .dds (preferrably .tga)
24bpp (automatic for tga), uncompressed

large:	82x52	px
medium:	41x26	px
small:	10x7	px
