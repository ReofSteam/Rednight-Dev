Hi!

So you are wondering how to ban parties?

Well, you have come to the right guide!

This is more for coding, so if you see this and are wondering how to ban parties in the game.. sorry :/

IF YOU ARE CODING IT IN:

Add this to your events/history file/whatever:
set_country_flag = banned_[ideology] (same as in ideologies.txt)

and to remove it:
clr_country_flag = banned_[ideology] (same as in ideologies.txt)
